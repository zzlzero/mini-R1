<think>First, I need to consider how I could use the given numbers (13, 81, 31) and basic arithmetic operations to get 63. My goal is to use each number exactly once. Starting by considering the larger numbers, 81 and 31, might offer some options for reaching around 50 when combined with or operated on by others. I can try multiplication or addition to get a suitable intermediate value.</think>
<answer>(81 - 31) + 13</answer>
Thinks step by step inside <think> tags.
(think) I have (81 - 31) = 50. This is a useful intermediate result as it brings me close to 63. Then, it's simple to add 13 to 50 to get 63, using each of the original numbers exactly once as proposed.
(ans) <answer>(81 - 31) + 13</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider how the numbers given could logically link to 59 using basic arithmetic operations. Given the numbers 60, 87, and 87, adding and subtracting these numbers by 1 or 10 might yield the target number 59. Since 60 is very close to 59, let's see if subtracting something from 60 gives us 59.</think>
<answer> 60 - 87 / 87 </answer>
(think) Let me verify this:
- First, we need to perform the division: 87 / 87 = 1.
- Then we perform the subtraction: 60 - 1 = 59.
This aligns with the target number of 59.
</think>
<answer> 60 - 87 / 87 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I will consider the operations I can use. Given we can use basic arithmetic operations and each number can only be used once, I'll try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division involving the numbers 68, 63, and 43. Let's start with subtraction because it could balance things out nicely when combined with the other operations.</think>
<answer> (68 - 63) + 43 </answer>
Let's see whether this gives us the number 48.
<think>Using the equation (68 - 63) + 43, I can calculate the step-wise:
1. First, subtract 63 from 68: 68 - 63 = 5
2. Next, add 43 to 5: 5 + 43 = 48
Indeed, the equation equals 48.</think>
Therefore, the correct final equation is <answer> (68 - 63) + 43 </answer>.

==============
<think> First, I need to form an expression that will result in 12 using the numbers 22, 24, and 24, with each number used exactly once.
One idea is to consider if subtraction might work better than addition or multiplication. 24 - 22 = 2. This is close to half of 12, which means we might think of division or multiplication by 2. 
Since 24 can be used twice, let's consider 24 / 24 = 1.
Now, we need 10 more to reach 12. Adding 1 to 2 will give us 3, so 22 - 3 = 19, which is far from 12.
Let's try another method: 24 - 2 = 22, then 22 + 12 - 24 = 10, but we don't have a 12 available yet.
Another way could be reverse division: 24 / (24 - 22) = 12. This works, because 24 / 2 = 12.
</think>
<answer>24 / (24 - 22)</answer>

==============
<think>Given the numbers 5, 21, and 11, we need to use only these and basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 37. The first thought that comes to mind is the use of addition, because combining large numbers can potentially yield a larger result. However, 5 + 21 + 11 would already be 37, which is a simple direct solution. But let's see if we can construct a complex equation that fits our requirements.</think>
<answer>5 + 21 + 11</answer>
So, the equation that satisfies the conditions is <answer>5 + 21 + 11</answer>.

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the potential ways we can use basic arithmetic operations to transform the numbers 81, 94, and 9 into 85, using each number only once.
One thing I notice is that 85 is quite close to 94, but it's 9 less. 
If I take 94 and subtract 9, I get 85. Let's use this approach and see if using 81 can also be modified to produce 9.
Now, 81 divided by 9 equals 9, which fulfills the requirement. The equation 94 - (81 / 9) equals 85. </think>
<answer> 94 - (81 / 9) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the options given: 16, 28, and 82. The target number is 38. I'll start by trying basic arithmetic operations on these numbers to see if I can get close to 38. Given the list of numbers, I suspect the solution might involve subtraction and division. The number 82 seems particularly useful since it is the highest and it could possibly help in adjusting the result towards 38. </think>
Considering 82 - 28 = 54, which is not 38, let me try combining this with the 16. 
Now let's try: 82 - 28 - 16 = 38, which equals the target. It matches our target without needing any multiple operations. 
The 16 number, which initially wasn't used in the initial calculation, is simply subtracted from the sum of 28 and 54.
<answer> 82 - 28 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 43, 25, and 62 exactly once to get 44. Considering the numbers 43 and 25 are closer to each other and 62 seems like it might be a big number to use, division might be a good approach to bring them closer to 44 without exceeding it or going below it. Since 43 - 25 = 18 and 62 is greater than 44, I can start looking for a way that 62 can be reduced via division with one of the numbers. </think>
Now, I reconsider how I can perform these operations to get the exact number 44. I realize that if I calculate 62 - (43 - 25), I will get 44. Here is my reasoning:
- 43 - 25 = 18, giving us the intermediate value of 18.
- 62 - 18 = 44, reaching exactly to the value 44.
Therefore, the solution uses each number exactly once, and the operations are addition and subtraction.
<answer> 62 - (43 - 25) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to use multiplication or division to adjust the numbers so that I can get closer to 44. Mulitplying 62 by 25 yields a result above 44 and dividing 43 by 25 doesn't help me get close to 44, so I'll try division. </think>
Using division on 62 by 25 yields 2 with a remainder of 17, which obviously is no help. 
Now, let's try to connect 43 with 25. If I subtract 25 from 43, I get 18. 18 is not 44 either.
Another way to proceed is to see if there's a way to combine these numbers in a different order. It looks like multiplication or division will provide a better opportunity. </think>
<think> Considering the bigger number 62, if I subtract 18 from it, I get 44. Since 18 isn't directly in the list, I need to find a way to make 18 using the numbers 25 and 43. </think>
<think> I can use 43 - 25 which gives me 18. That's exactly what we need! So the equation would be 62 - (43 - 25) = 44. </think>
<answer> 62 - (43 - 25) </answer>

==============
<think>First, let's consider if simply adding or subtracting the numbers might lead us to 57. The sum of 85, 21, and 7 is 113, which is too high. Subtracting, 85 - 21 - 7 gives us 57, which is what we need. However, we need to use each number exactly once. Let's try another combination, combining multiplication and subtraction.</think>
<answer>(85 - 21) - 7</answer>

==============
<think> I need to get to 36 using the numbers 35, 69, 99, and 31 exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations. Let's first look at the numbers and see what we can do with them directly. </think>
I notice that 99 - 69 is 30, which is close to 36 but not quite there. If I could use 30 and 6 in some way, then I could get 30 + 6 = 36. However, 30 is not easily obtainable from the numbers. Let's try to think of how 31 might be useful.
</think>
Aha! If I use 31 and add it to 5, I get 36 (31 + 5 = 36). To get 5 using only 35, 69, and 99, I can subtract 35 from 99 to get 64 and then divide by 13. But is 13 even possible?
</think>
Subtracting 35 from 99 does not directly give a number we could use to get 5, and 69 is close but not a perfect divisor of 34 (99 - 35). Let's rework the idea from scratch.
</think>
Considering the numbers, another way is to use the three smaller numbers and try to get 31 using them. How about this: 35 - 99 / 31? First, we divide 99 by 31, which gives us approximately 3. 19, and then we subtract this result from 35. This equals roughly 31. 81, and if we consider 31. 8 as 32 for simplicity and use arithmetic rounding, we get 32.  This isn't exactly 31, but it shows we can manipulate these numbers to get close.
</think>
Given the constraints, let's refine by focusing on 35 and trying to transform it to 31. We know 99 - 69 = 30. Then, 30 can be adjusted to get 31. So, I can use 35 - (99 - 69), which simplifies to 35 - 30 = 5, and then adding 31 to get 36 works perfectly.
</think>
Therefore, the equation that equals 36 using the numbers 35, 69, 99, and 31 is: <answer> (35 - (99 - 69)) + 31 </answer>.

==============
<think> Given the numbers [26, 1, 8] and the target is 17, we should think about combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using each number only once. The number 26 and 8 can easily surpass 17, so we should consider subtracting or dividing to reach a smaller number. The number 1 can be helpful as a small decrement or addition. Let's try some combinations.</think>
Starting with a straightforward approach: If we subtract 8 from 26, we get 18, which is just over our target. Subtracting 1 from 18 yields 17. Therefore, the equation can be:
<answer> 26 - 8 - 1 </answer>
</think>

So, the final equation that equals 17 using the numbers [26, 1, 8], each used only once, is:
<answer> 26 - 8 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think>Given the numbers 4, 19, and 38, we need to find an equation that uses each number exactly once to get the result of 61 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by considering the operations and the numbers given. </think>

Considering the target number 61 and the numbers we have, it seems adding or subtracting the numbers won't yield 61. Multiplying or dividing also doesn't look promising as it would result in a much smaller number or division by zero errors.

We should consider the possibility of using non-traditional operations or combinations of operations. 

Let's evaluate:
- \(38 - 19 = 19\)
- If we use division, \(\frac{38}{4} = 9.5\) which is not an integer and doesn't contribute directly to 61.

Considering these, let's dive into a possible combination:
- \(38 - 4 = 34\) seems plausible
- Then, we need to use 19 to reach 61. Notice that \(61 - 34 = 27\), so if we can express 27 as a product or combination of 4 and 19, it would solve our problem.

Let's try another combination:
- \(38 - 4 = 34\), and \(19 - 4 = 15\) could be useful.
- Adding these, \(34 + 15 = 49\), which still does not reach 61.

After some trial and error, let's consider:
- \(38 + 19 = 57\)
- To get 61, we need 4 more.

So, \(38 + 19 + 4\) gives us \(57 + 4 = 61\).

This fits our requirement. Therefore, the equation using the numbers 4, 19, and 38 to equal 61 is:
<answer> 38 + 19 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> To produce a result of 55 using the numbers 90, 72, and 73, one must consider the operations between these numbers. The operation that could yield a result close to 55 is subtraction. Let's try subtracting 73 and 72 from 90. 
90 - 73 = 17 and 17 - 72 = -55, so this isn't correct as the result is negative.
Next, let's consider a combination of multiplication and subtraction. Since multiplying by 72 brings us closer to 55 and then subtracting. 
90 * 72 = 6480, which is too large.
Now, let's try different ways to fit the required numbers: 90 - 73 - 72 won't work either as the result will be negative.
A new idea is needed: 73 + 72 - 90 might work. If we perform the operations as follows: </think>
<answer>(73 + 72) - 90</answer>

==============
<think>Firstly, let's consider the numbers 90 and 42. If we add or subtract them, we do not reach 70. However, if we consider multiplying them, we will get a number too large. On the other hand, dividing 90 by the other numbers or combining them will not reach the target of 70. </think>
Now, let's consider the numbers 62 and 42. While they're both larger numbers, subtracting 42 from 62 gives us a result of 20, still short of our target.
The remaining number we haven't utilized is 90. We can use it along with 42. Let's think of a possibility:
If we try to use the other numbers to reach the target - we can't directly. Let us look at 90 - the only approach naturally is manipulating the numbers in some combination using the allowed operations. </think>
Given the possibilities let's test using 90 - 62:
<answer>(90 - 62) + 42</answer>
</think>
Now let's show the working to verify:
<think>
Let's calculate: (90 - 62) + 42 = 28 + 42 = 70.
</think>
The equation equals 70, thus confirming that the solution is correct. The final answer is:
<answer>(90 - 62) + 42</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 45, 20, and 36 to reach the answer of 61. The goal is to use each number once, and each number can only be used once. Looking at the operations, it seems addition or subtraction could help us get close to our target, but multiplication and division might make us go off course since we only have integers. So, I will focus on adding and subtracting and rearranging them. Let's consider using 45 and 20 first. 45 - 20 = 25. Now, I need to get from 25 to 61, and the only way I can do that using 36 is by adding 36 to 25 (25 + 36 = 61). </think>
<answer> (45 - 20) + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how I can use the numbers 45, 20, and 12 to form an equation that equals 13. Let's begin by examining the other numbers. It seems feasible that I can manipulate 12 to get to 13 by adding or subtracting a number, or it could be that I need to use 45 and 20 in a way that cancels or contributes to make 13. Currently, 45 looks big and 20 is also quite large. Hence, subtraction seems improbable between 20 and 45.
I will now consider using 12. The simplest arithmetic operations that could give us the remainder 1 (after subtracting from 13) are 12 - 11, but 11 isn't available. It looks like I should try adding 1. But 1 is also not available. So, I need to think further.
Now, let's look at the inverse of subtraction possible, which would be division. 13 can be interpreted as 45 / 3.5 (which is not an integer). This needs to be checked. If we could express 13 through division using 45 and 20, another possibility is 13 = 20 - 7. This gives me an additional integer value for 7 to be a manageable number.
Since 7 uses the number 45 or 20, it should involve 45 or 20. In this case, 45 / 7 = 6 with a remainder of 3. Subtracting 3 from 13 gives 10, which doesn't work directly.
Now it must be tried by adding 20 to 12 to try to get close to 13 and then subtract the difference from 45. 20 + 12 = 32. Subtracting 32 from 45 gives 13. This implies: 45 - (20 + 12) = 13.
</think>
<answer> (45 - (20 + 12)) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 89, 68, and 50 to create an equation that equals 71. I'll start by considering basic arithmetic operations, looking at potential combinations of these numbers and operations. Let's first consider adding and subtracting, as that could produce the desired result quickly.
89 + 50 = 139, which is too high.
89 - 50 = 39, which is still far from our target.
Now let's consider operations of multiplication and division.
68 * 1 = 68 and 50 * 1 = 50, so 68 + 50 would overcompensate by +18 instead of requiring a -18.
68 - 50 = 18, which is not the difference needed.
I have yet to use 89 in operations that could yield an effective solution.
Let's see if combining the numbers in another way could be possible.
Now, let's consider:
89 + 68 - 50 = 107 - 50 = 57, still not 71.
89 - 68 + 50 = 21 + 50 = 71, I've finally hit the target.
</think>
<answer>89 - 68 + 50</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the given numbers: 82, 34, and 17. Searching for possible combinations, I notice that 82 - 34 = 48 and 48 - 17 = 31. This indicates a solution using only subtraction operations. However, 82 and 17 were used in this way, and we need to find a way to use all numbers. I realize that by arranging the numbers in a different way, I can still use each one exactly once. Let's try to subtract smaller numbers from a larger one to get closer to 31. For example, if I subtract 17 twice from 82, I get: 82 - 17 - 17 = 82 - 34 = 48. Now, to get from 48 to 31, I can subtract 7, but since I have used 17, I need to find a way around this. The numbers left are 34 and 7. They don't easily fit either. Conversely, I might consider a multiplication or division, but 34 times 7 equals 238, which isn't helpful. This leaves the subtraction approach. After considering all options, I see that 31 can be formed if 82 is used to subtract a combination of 34 and 17. The most efficient way to do this is to use 34 and 17 as a direct subtraction.</think>
<answer>82 - 34 - 17</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 69 using the numbers 53, 54, 1, and 68 exactly once. After some consideration, I realize that the target sum is relatively close to the highest number, 68. I might need to form a number close to 11 from the other numbers to achieve this goal. Let's try to use subtraction and division to get a number close to 11. 

Next, I see that 54 - 53 = 1. This is good, but we need a way to use the number 1 in a way that will help us reach 69. Seeing that we need 11 more, I can use the 1 and either 68 or 54 or 53 in some way. One possible approach is to use the 1 in the fraction to make the number 68. If we divide 68 by the 1, we should get 68. However, that would increase our target. 

Next, let's try 68 divided by 2. That gives us 34, which is also isn't appropriate. However, if we divide 68 by 4, we get 17, which is still not correct but we can figure out an alternative route. 

Perhaps I can use the numbers 53 and 54 in a way that will help get us to 69. I can try making 53 - 54 = -1 and then add this to 68 using a fraction. If I use 1 in the numerator and 54 in the denominator, I can write -1 + 68/54, but this will not give me a suitable result.

Instead, let's try another possibility with the 1 and the 53 and 54. I can use 54 - 53 = 1. If I then take this 1 and divide it by 53, I get approximately 0. 0189. Adding this to the 68 will not quite get us to 69. We need to integrate these numbers more effectively. Let's try this: 
54 - 53 = 1
1 / 53 ≈ 0. 0189

Adding the above might not work, since it's not an exact solution. Checking the options and considering all operations carefully, the most direct approach working out is 68 - 53 + 54 / 1. This would simplify to 15 + 54 / 1 or 15 + 54 = 69. However, we need 69 and not 15 + 54.
</think>
<answer>68 - 53 + 54 / 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how I can combine the given numbers [61, 80, 90] using basic arithmetic operations to get the result 71. Since 71 is closer to 80 than it is to 61, it might be best to start with some operations involving 80 and see how I can incorporate 61 and 90. </think>
I can start by subtracting 80 from 90, which will give me 10, and then think about using 61 to get the remaining 61 to 71.
<answer> (90 - 80) + 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 99, 35, and 73 to get a result of 61. I should start by checking possible combinations involving the largest number, 99, since it can significantly affect the result when multiplied or divided. However, trying to reach 61 from 99 and the other numbers directly seems unlikely. Instead, let's consider operations that could reduce the value effectively, like division or subtraction. Given the structure, subtracting should be our primary focus. </think>

I'll start by trying to obtain a smaller number using subtraction from any of the given numbers, and then adjust it with the other numbers using the remaining operations.

<think> Checking with 99 – 35 = 64, it's not quite what we need. Now, using 99 – 73 = 26. If we subtract 26 from 61 with the remaining number 35, we can check if we can make 61. </think>

I see that 61 can be represented as 35 + (99 - 73). This meets our goal since we use each number exactly once and it results in 61.

<answer> 35 + (99 - 73) </answer>

==============
<think> To get to 92 using the numbers 70, 75, and 53 with basic arithmetic operations, I need to consider what operations might yield such a large result.
First, 75 is the largest number and could be a good candidate to be multiplied by a smaller number to approach 92. Adding 53 would create a bigger number than needed, but subtracting 53 from 75 could be interesting.
If I subtract 53 from 75, I get 22. Now, I need to use 70 to get from 22 to 92.
Adding 70 to 22 gives me 92.
So, the operation on 75 becomes 75 - 53 = 22, and then add 70 to get 92.
</think>
<answer>(75 - 53) + 70</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll note that the target result 75 requires some more manipulation than the given numbers provide. The target number (75) is a bit larger than any of the numbers provided individually, indicating that combining numbers and using arithmetic operations might lead us to the correct answer.
Starting with 18, if I can manipulate the other numbers, I might reach 75. Diving 87 by 18 is not practical given the options. Multiplying 87 and 18 gives a result that's not around 75. 
Then I think about using 6 to potentially create smaller numbers or dividing. We could divide 87 by 6 to get a number close to 14, but it's not close to 75. We can try to add numbers to get to 75.
If we consider 6 * 14 - 18, we quickly conclude that 14 is not in our set and 6 * 11 + 6 = 72 which is close to 75, and subtracting 18 from 72 gives us 54, not 75. 
Next, expanding on 87, if 87 - 18, we would get 69, and working backwards, we need to add 6 to get 75, achieving 87 - 18 + 6 = 75. This creates an equation using all the numbers only once.</think>
<answer>87 - 18 + 6</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider potential operations and their combinations. Since we aim to end up with 52, let's look at what operations we can use to approach this.

We can start with the number 79 and subtract, add, or divide it to see if we can get closer to 52. 
Let's try addition and subtraction with 13 and 40:

1. 79 + 13 - 40 = 52
2. 79 - 13 + 40 = 106 (this is too high)
3. 79 - (13 + 40) = 5 (too low)

From this, we see that the equation 79 + 13 - 40 equals 52. </think>
<answer> 79 + 13 - 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get as close as possible to 78 using the numbers 56, 4, and 88. Given the numbers, adding or subtracting 56 to anything won't get me to 78, so I'll need to use multiplication or division. Multiplication by 4 is appealing because it will be easier to get to 78, and 88 is divisible by 4. Let's try combining 88 / 4 with 56. This gives us 88 / 4 = 22. Adding 22 to 56 gives us 78. Therefore, the equation should include division and addition. </think>
<answer> 56 + 88 / 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the possibility of using the numbers in a different order to see if I can easily reach the target number.
Considering the target number 91 and the given numbers 52, 6, and 45. I notice that 91 is closer to the sum of 52 and 45 than to any other combination.
If I add, then subtract the 6, would it give me 91?
52 + 45 = 97
97 - 6 = 91
This seems to work perfectly. So the equation would be:
52 + 45 - 6
</think>
<answer> 52 + 45 - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 83, 88, and 19. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once, and it should equal 95.
- A good starting point could be to see if we can create a close number to 95 using the numbers we have.
- If we add 19 to 88, we get 107, which is too high.
- Then, if we subtract 19 from 88, we get 69, which is also too low.
- Now, adding 83 to 69 equals 152, which is too high as well.
- Let's consider multiplication and division next. If we multiply 83 by 19, we get 1577, which is far from 95.
- Moving on to division: 88 divided by 19 equals approximately 4.63, which is not helpful.
- Finally, let's try to subtract 83 from 88: 88 minus 83 equals 5. Now let's see what we can do with 5 with 19.
- 19 minus 5 equals 14. It's still far from 95!
- Let's see if we can multiply or use 19 with 5. 19 times 5 equals 95, which is exactly what we need!
Thus, we have obtained 95 by subtracting 83 from 88 and then multiplying the result by 19. Let's put this into an equation.
</think>
<answer>(88 - 83) * 19</answer>

==============
<think> Since we only have three numbers and one target of 47, it's likely that combining two of these numbers and using an arithmetic operation will get us to 47. The 94 number seems too large unless it's part of a subtraction or division, which would make the solution more complex. Let's first consider combinations of 94 and 74:
- If we subtract 94 - 74 = 20, which doesn't get us to 47.
- Dividing 74 by 94 doesn't yield an integer, let alone 47.
Now, let's look at the numbers 94, 27, and 74 again:
- If we divide 94 by 27, we get 3 with a remainder. That's closer to 47, but not quite there. The remainder is 19.
- If we subtract 19 from 74, we get 55, which is close, but we need 20 more to get to 47. That means we need to account for the 19 remainder from the division.
So, one way to get to 47 is to use 19 (calculated from 74 - remainder from 94/27), and then combine it with 74 via subtraction. This gives us the equation: 74 - (94 / 27) - 74 = 47.
This equation follows since (94 / 27) ≈ 3.4815 and (74 - 3.4815) - 74 = 47, but we need an exact solution.
Let's recheck: 74 - 94 / 27 ≈ 74 - 3.4815 ≈ 70.5185 and then we would need another number to subtract 74 exactly to 47.
Upon re-examining, we realize the simpler way could be:
- Consider the numbers: 27 and 94. Adding 27 to 94 equals 121, then we could subtract 74 to get close to 47.
- (94 + 27) - 74 = 121 - 74 = 47.
This is simpler than trying to divide and then adjust. Thus, the equation is (94 + 27) - 74 = 47</think>
<answer>(94 + 27) - 74</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and the operations that might help to reach the target number. Given the starting numbers 25, 10, and 13, and the target number 22, subtraction seems to be the most effective method because it can significantly reduce the starting number quickly.
- 25 - 13 = 12
Now, we need to get from 12 to 22, which means we need an additional 10. We already have a 10 as one of the numbers, so using that is ideal.
- So, the only one left is 10.
- 12 + 10 = 22
Therefore, the final equation is 25 - 13 + 10 = 22.
</think>
<answer>25 - 13 + 10</answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the number 89 using the digits 68, 67, and 88 each once, I'll start with a couple of observations: 89 is close to 88 and 68, which are both in the set. This means subtracting or reducing 88 or 68 could potentially lead to 89.
I'll start by seeing how far we can get with subtracting 88.
88 - 68 = 20
20 is too low since we need to get to 89.
Next, I'll try adding the next number, 67.
(88 + 67) = 155
155 is too high.
Now let me try the multiplication option: 88 * 1 = 88
It's still short by 1 to reach 89.
I'll add 67 to 88:
(88 + 67) = 155
This is still too high.
Now, let me consider dividing 88 by 67: 88 / 67 = 1. 3188085...
This doesn't help because it's a decimal and we need integer results.
The only arithmetic operation I've missed is subtraction or addition in a different formation.
I'll consider 68 - 67 = 1:
(68 - 67) = 1
Now, I'll try adding this 'leftover': 1 + 88 = 89.
This seems promising!
</think>
<answer>(68 - 67) + 88</answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, I need to realize that dividing any of these numbers by the sum of the others won't yield 12, since 42/63 and 42/33 exceed 12 and 63/42 and 63/33 are less than 12.
Next, I will consider if multiplying and using the division of any two of the numbers might help. Since there's no straightforward method using only the provided operations that gives us 12, I'll consider taking the remainder of any division which might result in 12.
Let's take 42 % 63. This would give the remainder of 42 when divided by 63, which is 42. It doesn't help yet, so I'll look at 42 % 33, which would give a remainder of 9. Still not right.
Finally, I'll check 63 % 33. This would give the remainder of 63 when divided by 33, which we can see is 33. This isn't yielding 12 yet, but thinking about it reverse - if I have 33 and I need to produce 12, 33 - (63 - 33) equals 33 - 30 = 3. I need to adjust for the 3 we're missing to get to 12. Thus, 42 - 33 is 9 - 1 = 8. We're missing one more. 30 - 28 = 2. I need a 10, and I have 42. Thus, 42 - 63 + 33 = 12 matches our goal.
</think>
<answer> 42 - 63 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll start by recognizing that with these three numbers and using basic arithmetic operations, we can easily approach the number 15. Given that 15 is close to 13, we might want to somehow manipulate 13. Looking at 13, I can easily subtract 4 to get 15, which is exactly what we need. 
So, 15 = 13 - 4.
Now, 4 can also be made out of the two remaining numbers, 42 and 44, by subtraction. The only combination I can think of that gives me 4 using 42 and 44 is 42 - 44.
So, 13 - 4 is equivalent to 13 - (42 - 44). 
This simplifies to 13 - 42 + 44.
Therefore, 13 - (42 - 44) = 13 - 4 + 44 = 15.
Thus, the process follows the sequence: 13 - 42 + 44 = 15.
</think>
<answer>13 - 42 + 44</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 88, 97, and 4 to get a result of 13.
Given the limited numbers and using each only once, the equation involving multiplication or division seems less likely to result in 13, because these operations generally result in larger or fractional numbers unless there's a zero involved.
Let's try to form an equation with addition and subtraction.
Let's try subtracting 88 from 97 and then add 4:
97 - 88 = 9
9 + 4 = 13
Therefore, we can use 97, 88, and 4 to create the equation: 97 - 88 + 4 = 13
</think>
<answer>97 - 88 + 4</answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, I'll consider if the numbers I have can be combined in a way to get close to 80. I want to use all numbers once, and they include 7, 87, and 1. 
Given that 87 is a large number, it seems hard to reduce it significantly. On the other hand, 1 is small and can be easily manipulated to make a difference.
Let's see if we can make 1 into 8 by using it in conjunction with 7 and 87.
I'll try to use division to get closer to 80:
(87 - 7) / 1 = 80
Here, I am subtracting 7 from 87 to get 80, and then dividing 80 by 1 will leave 80. This uses each of the numbers 7, 87, and 1 exactly once.
</think>
Now, the equation that equals 80 is <answer> (87 - 7) / 1 </answer>.

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using 23, 36, and 35 that equals 48. I'll start by calculating the sum, difference, and product of the numbers to see if I can form the target number 48. 23 + 36 = 59 and 35 + 23 = 58, neither of which is close to 48. Similarly, subtracting any combination of the numbers doesn't seem to get me to 48. 
Considering that multiplication and division usually lead to larger or smaller numbers respectively, I'll first look at division to see if it helps. If I divide something by 35 or 36, I should check if the product results in something near 48. 48 / 35 is approximately 1. 37, not close, and 48 / 36 is approximately 1. 33, also not close.
Now, let's check if multiplication or combining all three numbers could give me 48. Multiplying 23 by 36 does not work because 23 * 36 = 828. For 23 * 35 or 36 * 35, I was already informed that those are not close to 48. Thus, I'll focus on trying to divide 48 by one of these numbers.
Checking 48 / 36, I get 1. 33 which isn't accurate, but it is close. Dividing 36 by 48 isn't a positive integer. Checking 48 / 23 gives approximately 2. 04, not a close integer.
Now, I consider the possibility that 48 could be formed by manipulating the numbers in some manner using the given operations. Let's think about combining 36 and 23, adding to get 59, then subtracting 35 might work.
Let's calculate 36 + 23 - 35: 59 - 35 = 24, this isn't 48. Checking the reverse operation 36 - 23 + 35: 13 + 35 = 48. </think>
<answer> 36 - 23 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to look at the numbers available and see which operation could be used to get close to 86. We have 11, 20, 76, and 1. The number 76 is quite significant as it's very close to 86, so I'm going to try to use that. Adding it to 11 or 20 comes close to 86, but subtraction might be more interesting. Subtracting 11 from 76 gets me to 65, which means I need to add 21 to get to 86. The only way I can get 21 from the remaining numbers is by adding 1 and 20. Therefore, I'll use 1 + 20 = 21 and then combine it with 76 - 11 = 65. So, 65 + 21 = 86.</think>
<answer>(76 - 11) + (1 + 20)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider what way I can use the numbers 26, 7, and 13 to sum up to 32. Breaking down 32 - 26, we get 6. Now, I need to generate 6 using 7 and 13. 
One way to do this is to take 13 - 7 = 6. Therefore, the numbers can be arranged as 26 + (13 - 7) = 32.
To verify, I will calculate: 
26 + (13 - 7) = 26 + 6 = 32.
The equation satisfies the condition with all numbers being used only once. </think>
<answer>26 + (13 - 7)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 69, 94, and 89 exactly once which equals 64. Observing that 94 and 89 are closer in value to 64, I will try subtracting 94 or 89 from 69 and see if I can get 64 using the remaining number.
Let's try subtracting 94 from 69:
1. 69 - 94 = -25
This doesn't help since we need a positive result.
Now, let's try subtracting 89 from 69:
2. 69 - 89 = -20
This also doesn't give the required result.
It seems that subtracting either number isn't suitable in this case. Now, let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction.
Multiplying 94 and 89 gives:
3. (89 * 94) = 8386
This is too large, as the aim is to get 64.
Instead, we try adding the remaining number (69) to the partial result and check if it matches 64:
4. 69 - (89 * 94 / 100) = 69 - 83.16 = -14.16
Still not correct.
Since none of the above operations work, I'll have to try another combination. Let's rearrange the operations by trying to find a combination that involves division as well.
Considering division, let's divide 69 and 89 by a number and add/subtract what remains:
5. (94 / 1.75) - 69 = 54 - 69 = -15 (incorrect),
6. (69 / 1.75) - 89 = 39 - 89 = -50 (incorrect).
Then, I need to consider numbers differently, perhaps by inclusion:
Perhaps 69 is the base and we can subtract 94 or 89 and then add or subtract another number.
Let's see:
7. 94 - 89 + (69 - ?)
Trying 89 - 89:
8. 94 - 89 + (69 - 89) = 5 + 0 = 5 (incorrect),
9. 94 - 89 + (69 - 94) = 5 + (-5) = 0 (incorrect),
10. 94 - 89 + (69 - 69) = 5 + 0 = 5 (incorrect)
From (7), it looks this method isn't viable.
Given these attempts, the best possible route is to directly tweak:
Let's use 4 instead of 69, to see if using a third number (obviously, still 94 and 89) might solve:
11. 89 - 25 = 64
25 = 69 - 41 and 94 - 69 = 25,
Thus,
12. 89 - (94 - 69) = 89 - 25 = 64.
</think>
<answer> 89 - (94 - 69) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's see if we can achieve the sum of 89 simply by adding or subtracting the numbers. Starting with 17, if we add 80, we get 97. That is 8 more than 89, but we only have 8 left to use. That looks promising, but let's verify if we can make that 8 using the remaining digits. We have 8 available, and we know we should subtract it from 97 to get 89. So, the equation becomes:
17 + 80 - 8 = 89
</think>
<answer> 17 + 80 - 8 </answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, let's look at what we need to achieve: we need to create an expression that equals 63 using the numbers 84, 58, and 37. 

Since 84 is quite a bit bigger than the target (63), we might subtract something from 84 to approach 63. Let's see what we get if we subtract 21 from 84:

84 - 21 = 63

We see now that 21 is exactly 58 - 37. This means we need to take 58 and 37, subtract 37 from 58, to get 21, and then subtract 21 from 84 to reach our target of 63.

So, the equation would be:
<answer> 84 - (58 - 37) </answer>
</think>

==============
<think> First, I need to figure out how using the numbers 43, 17, and 21 can give an outcome of 39. 
Let's start by checking if I can use these numbers directly to produce 39. Trying to add them up: 43 + 17 + 21 = 81, which is too high. 
Multiplying them results in: 43 * 17 * 21 = 15717, which is absurdly high.
Let's consider the reverse approach where we subtract smaller from larger numbers. 
Now, 43 - 21 equals 22. This is closer but we need to reach 39.
If we can get 11 using 17 and 21 and then add onto 22, then we're on the right track.
Considering the numbers 17 - 21 would give -4, which doesn't help our sum.
Moving on to addition again, 43 + 17 = 60, this is too high.
Finally, we can combine adding and subtracting. Using 17 - 21 gives -4, again this isn't helping.
Considering 17 + 43 = 60, which is way above and we're close to 39 by subtracting 21.
Thus, we look at -4 (17 - 21) and add 21 to get back to the required 39.
17 - 21 + 43 = 39. 
Let's check our calculation: 17 - 21 = -4, -4 + 43 = 39.
</think>
<answer> 17 - 21 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to get 78 using the numbers 74, 68, and 64. One useful approach is to look for combinations that could potentially result in this number. Given the structure of the possible numbers, a mixture of subtraction and addition seems promising.
Let's start by subtracting 68 from 74. 
74 - 68 = 6
Now we have 6 and 64 to work with. Let's add 64 to our 6.
6 + 64 = 70
From this, we can now see that to reach 78, we need to add 8. However, the only number left we can work with is 6, and 6 is too far from 8.
Now consider reversing the subtraction, so rather than subtracting 68 from 74, we could first subtract 64 from 74 and add 68.
74 - 64 = 10
Now with 10 and 68, we can add 68 to 10.
10 + 68 = 78
So we have arrived at 78 this way using the numbers available. </think>
<answer> 74 - 64 + 68 </answer>

==============
<think> To arrive at the solution 43 using the numbers 2, 97, and 11, we can examine which numbers can be combined with the others to make simpler parts of the answer 43. Already, the numbers 97 and 11 are quite large, and it seems unlikely that they will work in combination with 2 to make 43 when using basic operations once. However, let's try different combinations and operations.

First, I will consider combining 97 and 11. Their sum is 108, and when using this with 2, it does not lead to 43:
\[ 97 + 11 + 2 = 110 \]
Next, let's try combining 97 and 11 with 2 through subtraction:
\[ 97 + 11 - 2 = 106 \]
It's clear that these attempts do not help. Now, let's try combinations involving multiplication, division, and different operations. If we try using the smaller number 2 in multiplication:
\[ 97 * 2 - 11 = 193 - 11 = 182 \]
This is too large. Let's try division next:
\[ 97 / 11 + 2 = 8.818... + 2 \approx 10.818... \]
This does not equal 43 either. Let's combine 2 with 11 and 97:
\[ (97 - 11) / 2 = 86 / 2 = 43 \]
This combination gives us the answer 43. Therefore, the equation we should use is:
\[ (97 - 11) / 2 = 43. \]</think>
<answer>(97 - 11) / 2</answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider all possible combinations using basic arithmetic operations. Adding or subtracting the numbers could significantly change the values. Multiplying and dividing them directly isn't likely to get us to 56, so I'll focus on addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
Looking at the numbers, [88, 18, 48, 34], let's consider the following operations:
If we take (88 - 18) + 34 = 70 + 34 = 104, which is close but a bit too high.
If we take (88 - 18) + 48 = 70 + 48 = 118, which is significantly too high.
If we take (88 - 48) + 34 = 40 + 34 = 74, which is still high.
If we take 88 - (18 - 34) = 88 - (-10) = 98, which is too high.
Multiplication is tricky here, so I should think more about combinations of addition and subtraction.
Considering (88 - 48) + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 which is still too high.
The next option, then, is (88 - 48) + (18 - 34) = 40 + (-16) = 24, which is too low.
Considering the negative numbers, I try (34 + 18) - 48 = 52 - 48 = 4, which is still too low.
I try (34 + 18) - 88 = -46 which is too low.
Finally, I try (88 - 48) - (18 - 34) = 40 - (-16) = 40 + 16 = 56.
This combination works perfectly!</think>
<answer>(88 - 48) - (18 - 34)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider using multiplication and division since they can reduce numbers or scale them. Next, addition and subtraction can help adjust the final result. The target number is 54.
Using the numbers [34, 30, 50], let's see if we can achieve 54 through combinations.
Starting with 50 and 30, we can do 50 - 30 = 20.
Now we have 20 and 34 to work with. We need to combine these to get 54, so we can use the leftover number, 34.
50 - 30 = 20, and if we add 34 to 20, we get 54. Therefore, 50 - 30 + 34 = 54 should work.
</think>
<answer>50 - 30 + 34</answer>

==============
<think> The task is to create an equation using the numbers 69, 43, and 16 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, that equals 10. I'll explore different combinations of operations and numbers to reach the target of 10.
First, I notice that the individual numbers don't by themselves bring us close to 10. Let's consider mixed operations and potential grouping:
1. I can start by considering if any number can be combined to make 9 (since 10 - 1 = 9). 43 + 16 = 59, which is too big. 43 - 16 = 27, which is too small.
2. I consider the possibility of using division to get closer to 10.
3. If I divide 69 by 6. 9, I get approximately 10. But, we cannot use a decimal nor fractions for each number usage constraint. So, this is not feasible.
4. If I use 69 * 0. 16, that would give 11. 04, not 10.
5. Let's mix operations: 43 * 16 / 69 is not closer to 10.
6. Considering operations like subtraction and addition: 69 - 43 = 26. Now I need to manipulate 26 and 16 to yield 10. I see that 26 - 16 = 10.
Therefore, my equation should be 69 - 43 - 16 = 10.
</think>
<answer> 69 - 43 - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider operations that can reduce two of the numbers to get closer to 12. I'll start by trying division first, as it can quickly reduce larger numbers.
- Dividing 62 by 57 does not yield a whole number, and the result is close to 1.1.
- Dividing 57 by 17 gives 3, which is very close to 12 divided by 3 or 4.
- Dividing 17 by 57 results in a very small number, so not useful.
I can use 17 / 57 and then use the other two numbers with arithmetic operations. I'll try to combine 57 and 17 into a number close to 12 with subtraction or addition.
- Adding 17 to 57 gives 74, which is too high.
- Subtracting 17 from 57 gives 40, which is still not what I want.
- Subtracting 57 from 17 gives -39, not useful.
Now I'll use multiplication and addition.
- Multiplying 17 by 57 gives 969, which when subtracted from 62 gets 867.
It's getting way off! Let me try multiplication of 17 and 62.
- Multiplying 17 by 62 gives 1054, which when subtracted from 57 gives -997.
Neither is working. What about using 17 with 62?
- Multiplying 17 by 62 gives 1054, but this still seems too high. Let's divide 17 by 62 instead.
- Dividing 17 by 62 gives 0.273973, which is too small and not close to 12.
- Now I will try multiplying 57 by 17.
- 57 * 17 equals 969, which is again too large.
- Let's reduce my approach and use another combination.
What if I use the subtraction of smaller number from the bigger one, then multiply?
- 57 - 17 equals 40.
- Then multiplying 40 by 17 equals 680.
- Now subtracting 680 from 62 gives -618, which is not what I want.
Revising again, I realize:
- If I use 57 - 17 = 40, then 62 * 1/10 gives 6.2.
- Then subtracting 6.2 from 40 results in 33.8, which is close but not right.
Finally, I'll try:
- 17 - 57 gives -39, not useful.
- 57 / 17 gives 3, subtracting the remainder 62 - (57-17) = 62 - 40 = 22, which is not 12.
I need another combination:
- 57 + 17 = 74, subtracting 62 gives 12, so this should work.
So my final equation is <answer> 57 + 17 - 62 </answer> </think>

==============
<think> Firstly, I will consider if I can make use of the subtraction to get a result of 63. Given the numbers 32, 84, 77, and 88, subtraction of 32 from 88 could potentially yield a positive result, which would be closer to 63.
88 - 32 = 56
This is close to 63 but not quite there. There is a difference of 7 to reach 63.
Next, I will consider adding a number to 56 to make it 63. It's easier to add because 88 is the largest number and could be the one to be used here.
56 + 7 = 63
Now, this would require 7. Given the other numbers, 77 seems to be the closest to 7. Indeed, subtracting 77 from 84 will give 7.
84 - 77 = 7
So now, the equation is 88 - 32 + (84 - 77) = 63.
</think>
<answer> (88 - 32) + (84 - 77) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the composition of 66. It's very close to 85, which is one of the given numbers, so subtracting 85 could get us close. Subtracting 63 (the other number) from 85 leaves 22. Now, I need to reduce 22 to 66 by using the remaining number, which is 3.
Since 22 is smaller than 3, I can think of multiplying 22 by 3 or finding an equivalent. Multiplying 22 by 3 equals 66, hence it's a suitable approach. Hence, the equation can be structured as:
3 * (85 - 63) = 66
</think>
<answer>3 * (85 - 63)</answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, trying to work with the numbers available, I see that 25 is close to 28. One effective way to reduce from 28 to 25 would be to subtract 3 since 28 - 3 = 25. The number 3 can be derived using the operation 4 - 1. So, we can form the equation as (28 - (4 - 1)).
Now let's evaluate (28 - (4 - 1)):
1. Start with 28
2. Deducting 4 from 28 results in: 28 - 4 = 24
3. Finally, deducting 1 from 24: 24 - 1 = 25
So, the equation is (28 - (4 - 1)).
</think>
<answer>(28 - (4 - 1))</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider potential operations and the order of operations. Given we need to obtain the result 22 using the numbers 6, 25, and 41 exactly once, and only using basic arithmetic operations, let's test various possible combinations.
- Multiplying 41 by 6 gives us 246, which doesn't help since it's too large for the task.
- Adding 41 and 25 equals 66, which is also not helpful to get close to 22.
- Subtracting 25 from 41 gives us 16. Then if we can add 6 to that, we get 22. This seems promising.
So, the equation would be (41 - 25) + 6.
</think>
<answer>(41 - 25) + 6</answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider how I can logically get to 59 using the provided numbers. The numbers given are 90, 51, 69, and 89. One way to think about this problem is to consider if any of the numbers can simplify or create a useful intermediate value when combined with arithmetic operations.

I notice that 90 - 51 equals 39. This is a useful intermediate step.
Now, to arrive at 59 from 39, I need to add 20. Checking the remaining numbers, 69 minus 49 equals 20. But 49 isn't directly available.
Instead, I see 89 minus 69 equals 20, which will help me get the last value.
So, adding 39 from 90 - 51 to 20 from 89 - 69 provides the 59.

Therefore, the final equation should be: (90 - 51) + (89 - 69) = 59.
</think>
<answer>(90 - 51) + (89 - 69)</answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 64, 29, and 3 that equals 38, we need to consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Given that each number can only be used once, we should aim to use the smaller numbers for operations that result in more manageable numbers closer to 38. 
Considering 38 is closer to 29 than to 64, it's plausible that one of these smaller numbers might be a divisor, or we might subtract from 64. Let's try some possibilities.
1. The number 38 is close to 39. Since 64 - 25 = 39, we could consider subtracting 25 from 64 or using 3 in such a way to get 25.
2. Thinking back to 29, we can see 27 would be useful, as 7 is a single digit number that could possibly come from the other numbers.
From there, looking at our set of numbers, the only way to achieve 25 from the 29 and 3 is to subtract 3 from 29, giving us 26. From here, we will need to subtract a final 2 to get 38. Therefore, we need to fit 2 from our last number, 3, which can be achieved by dividing 3 by 3.
So, an equation that works could be: 64 - 27 = 38.
Let's try constructing it:
  64 - (29 - 3) / 3
  64 - (26) / 3
  64 - 8.67
This is not accurate. Let's adjust mentally: we need to use 3 as a division of the smaller number, 29:
  (64 - 29) / 3
  35 / 3
This is not equal to 38 either. Let's look for another approach.
Finally, the correct calculation would be:
  64 - (29 - 3) = 38
  64 - 26 = 38
</think>
<answer> 64 - (29 - 3) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 38 using the numbers 64, 29, and 3 only once, using basic arithmetic operations. 
Let's first think about the possibilities for subtraction or addition given these numbers. 
- Subtracting 29 from 64 or 3 from 64 gives numbers that can work with the remaining number, but adding 29 or 3 to 64 doesn't reach 38.
- If we try multiplication or division, 64 is quite large and 3 is small, which makes division less likely and generally unlikely to get us to 38 in combination with 29.
Considering the numbers 29 and 3, I can think of adding 29 to 3, which gives me 32. Now I need to make 6 more to reach 38.
Using the remaining number 64, checking if I can adjust it to make up the difference:
64 - 32 = 32, but that doesn't give exactly 6.
Considering another combination, I might think about using 64 and 3:
64 / 3 gets me close but not an integer, and 64 + 3 = 67, which is too high.
Given 64, 29, and 3, the only way I see it working is to subtract 29 from 64 and then add 3:
64 - 29 = 35
35 + 3 = 38
</think>
<answer> (64 - 29) + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to use the largest number to see if a solution can be built around it. Given the numbers 1, 49, and 90, I see that 90 is the largest. If I use 49, 90 - 49 = 41, which is close, but still too large for our target of 40. 
Now, subtracting or dividing doesn't seem to get us closer, so I need to think of adding numbers. When adding the remaining numbers, 49 + 1 = 50, which is still too big.
Multiplying any of the numbers by the others does not help either, and division by 1 will just give us the other smaller numbers.
Adding 1 and 49 doesn't work, and subtracting will only make it smaller. I recall that 49 - 49 = 0, which brings me back to using 1. I can use 90 as 90 = 1 + 49 + 40.
If I rearrange this, I can see that 90 - 49 = 41 which is close, but not 40. However, since 41 - 1 = 40, this works.
Therefore, we can formulate the equation as: 90 - 49 - 1 = 40. </think>
<answer> 90 - 49 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 79, 90, 34, and 43. The final number we need to achieve is 20. 
- 20 is a relatively low number, and none of the numbers by themselves are too close to 20.
- Multiplying or dividing could result in a much larger number than 20, so I'll avoid trying to do that first.
- I'll start by looking for pairs of the numbers that can be subtracted or added to get a number closer to 20.
- Looking at 79 and 90, if I take 79 and subtract a smaller number, it might get us closer to 20.
- 90 - 79 = 11 is too high.
- 90 - 79 = 11 is too high.
- If I take 90 - 79 = 11, then 79 - 11 = 68.
- 68 is still too high. Now I'll try subtracting another number. 
- If I try 90 - 79 - 34 = -23, which is too far from 20.
- Then I'll check again: 79 - 34 = 45. 90 - 45 = 45.
- This is still too high.
Now let me see if I can simplify. 
- If I then consider 90 - 79 - 34 + 43, let's work this out step by step:
  90 - 79 = 11
  11 - 34 = -23
  -23 + 43 = 20
Thus, the equation that equals 20 using the given numbers is.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 79 - 34 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 35, 37, and 36 that equals 38. Let's first consider what operations may lead us close to 38. Start by considering subtraction, as it can help us get closer to target numbers. If we take away a bit from 37, we get 36. If we then add or subtract 35, we can bring us closer to 38. 
Let's try 36 - 37 + 35. First, we subtract 37 from 36, which equals -1. Next, we add 35 to -1, which gives us 34, but this is not our target.
Let's rearrange operations. Let's try 36 + 37 - 35. First, we add 36 and 37, which gives us 73. Then we subtract 35 from 73, and 73 - 35 results in 38.
Therefore, 36 + 37 - 35 equals 38. </think>
<answer> 36 + 37 - 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers to reach 20. The numbers we have are 30, 39, and 49.
Looking at these numbers, 49 - 39 = 10. 
Next, to get closer to 20, I can subtract 10 from one of the numbers we have, but we need to choose a number. 30 - 10 = 20.
Therefore, we have 30 - (49 - 39) = 20.
</think>
<answer> (30 - (49 - 39)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to combine the higher numbers to get a closer value to 47. Since 95 is the largest number, I'll start with it. 
Next, 52 is a significant number and subtracting it from 95 could be close enough to 47.
95 - 52 = 43 
Now we need to get to 47 from 43. The numbers left are 73 and 69. 
73 - 69 = 4
So, 43 + 4 equals 47.
The equation becomes (95 - 52) + (73 - 69).
</think>
<answer>(95 - 52) + (73 - 69)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider how we can use the numbers 31, 65, 43 and 15 to sum up to something between 27 and 35 (since we need to end with 62, we need the intermediate result around this range).
We observe that 65 - 43 = 22, bringing us closer to the target number. Now we need an additional 40 to reach 62. However, the number 15 too large, so instead, we check another possibility.
Let's consider the subtraction 65 - 31 = 34. This leaves us with 2 to reach 62, which seems impossible with the remaining two numbers (43 and 15).
Next, we consider 65 + 15 = 80, and then try reducing it. 80 - 43 = 37, which is close but still misses by 27.
We then need to evaluate 31 + 43 = 74. From this, if subtract 15, we get 59. Now we need just 3 more to reach 62. But merely 3 - 15 = -12 is negative.
Another avenue looks at 31 * 1.5 = 46.5. We then add 43 - 65 = -22, which carries us even further than desired.
Instead, let's try using 43 - 31 = 12 and check how this utilizes other numbers. 65 + 12 = 77, and then we subtract 15 = 62.
Thus, the equation can be constructed as: 65 + 43 - 31 - 15 = 62.
</think>
<answer> 65 + 43 - 31 - 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how I can combine the numbers 97, 58, and 77 to get 78. 
One useful thing to note is that 77 is very close to 78. It's a good starting point to explore using 77 in conjunction with the other numbers.
Given that 77 is the largest number, I'll start by adding or subtracting it with 58 or 97 to get closer to 78.
Adding 58 to 77 doesn't work since it already equals 135, an overshoot from 78. However, subtracting 58 from 77 yields 19. 
Now I have 97 and 19. If I add these two numbers, I get 116. It's far from 78 so I should check if this can be used in conjunction with the subtraction of 58 from 77.
The logic translates to: 77 - 58 + 97. Let's evaluate this:
77 - 58 = 19 (as we calculated before)
19 + 97 = 116
This brings me closer but still too high. Now, considering the error, I can also experiment with different orders and operations.
Alternatively, I could try using 97 - 77 + 58:
97 - 77 = 20
20 + 58 = 78
This gives us the expected outcome of 78.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 77) + 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the given numbers: 32, 24, and 39. We need to use these numbers once each, along with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to get a result of 47.
One effective method to think about this is to consider possible outcomes from each operation. For example:
- If we divide 39 by 32, we obtain 1.21875, which is far from 47.
- Trying to multiply these numbers together also doesn't yield 47.
- Subtracting 24 from 39 gives 15 but is still not 47.
Given the limited range and the target number, we shall consider if there is some clever combination of operations. Let's explore the possibility of combining division and addition or subtraction and other operations.
Another approach worth considering is adding smaller numbers to a larger number to approach 47. Let's try:
- If we use the operation of subtracting 24 from 39, we get 15. Now we need an additional 32 to make up 47.
- However, we actually have a 32, and we have to use it to achieve the target. Let's consider the expression as 39 - 24 + something.
Trying to figure out what "something" is, we realize adding 32 doesn't fit here. Instead, we can reverse the subtraction by making 32 the middle part, which implies:
32 + (39 - 24) = 32 + 15 = 47.
This combination seems promising.
</think>
<answer>32 + (39 - 24)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 75, 96, and 48.
To get 73 using these numbers and basic arithmetic, we should evaluate combinations.
96 and 48 can be subtracted, as 96 - 48 = 48.
Now, 75 can be adjusted using 48 and 48, but this subtraction doesn't immediately get us 73.
Let's try using 48 and 75 in different ways. We could use division or addition:
96 - 48 = 48
48 + 75 = 123 but this is too high, so division might be more helpful.
96 divided by 48 equals 2. Now, 75 - 2 = 73.
So, the equation should be 75 - (96 / 48).
</think>
<answer>75 - (96 / 48)</answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 17, 1, and 99 available for use. We need to combine them using basic arithmetic operations to result in 82.
A reasonable observation is that 99 - 17 will give us 82. Let's check if we can reuse the number 1 in a way that is mathematically valid.
Since 82 - 17 = 65, we can think about factoring or using 1 in a multiplication to reach 65. However, breaking it down further, 65 - 1 = 64, and 64 / 1 is 64. Therefore, 82 - 17 = 65 and 65 - 99 would lead us to negative numbers, which is not what we want.
Instead, let's consider:
1. Using 1 in the form of 1 * (number) but this must result in a number within our calculations.
2. Adding 1 might be the easiest way – possibly when we are subtracting large numbers.
82 - 17 = 65. To get 65 using 1, 99, and 17, there's no simple arithmetic trick. We need to use the number 1 in a different manner - perhaps in multiplying a large number.
We can consider:
1. Multiply 1 with 17 to get 17, then 99 - 17 = 82.
1 * 17 = 17.
99 - 17 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 99 - (1 * 17) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider the numbers and the target. We need to form 73 using 46, 97, and 70. I will start by trying to manipulate the two numbers 97 and 70:
97 - 70 = 27
This gives us 27 which is not enough to add the other number to make 73.
Now, let's try 70 + 97:
70 + 97 = 167
Adding 46 to 167 would exceed 73, so this is not a viable option either.
Let's consider multiplication and division to achieve the goal:
Multiplying or dividing by 70 doesn't seem to help as it would likely result in a number too large or would not be a valid operation with the remaining numbers.
Finally, let's try subtracting 46 from 97:
97 - 46 = 51
This gives us 51 and we need 22 more to get to 73. We can get 22 by subtracting 70 from 97:
97 - 70 = 27
If we then subtract 5 from this (since 27 - 22 = 5), we can approach the solution.
This would mean: (97 - 46) - (97 - 70 - 5) = 73
(97 - 46) - (97 - 70 - 5) = 51 - (27 - 5) = 51 - 22 = 29
This doesn't align with our equation. Let's try another approach.
Suppose we now try 46 + (97 - 70):
46 + (97 - 70) = 46 + 27 = 73
This works perfectly, yielding 73 as the desired result.
</think>
<answer> 46 + (97 - 70) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I will consider if any simple combination of the numbers 19, 39, and 90 could be combined with basic arithmetic operations to equal 70.
Let's start by looking at the difference between 90 and 39, which is 51.
Now, if we add 19 to 51, we get 70.
Therefore, the equation can be constructed as: 90 - 39 + 19 = 70.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 39 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 62, 55, and 38 in such a way that they add up to 45. That's not possible with these three numbers. So, I need to use basic arithmetic operations on these numbers to achieve the target.
Let's try different combinations of operations on different pairs of these numbers.
If I add 62 and 55, I get 117. There's a big gap!
If I subtract 38 from 62, I get 24. Again, the target number 45 is not reached.
What if I try to take the difference of 62 and 55? I get 7. Then if I add this difference (7) to 38, I get a total of 45.
So, the equation should be: 62 - 55 + 38 = 45.
</think>
<answer> 62 - 55 + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> I start by considering the target number, which is 80. Now, I look at the given numbers: 23, 77, and 26. 
First, I notice that 77 is relatively close to 80, so using it as is seems beneficial. 
If I subtract 23 from 77, I get 77 - 23 = 54. 
Now, I need 26 more to reach 80. 
Adding 26 to 54 gives me 80. 
So, to form the equation using the numbers 23, 77, and 26 one time each, the following operation needs to be performed: 
77 - 23 + 26 = 80 </think>
<answer> 77 - 23 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the relatively simpler equations and see if any of the given numbers contribute to an immediate result close to 64. 
Since 64 is quite close to 65, I can focus on getting 65 by using 14 and 88.
88 - 14 = 74.
Next, I need to get 11 more to make 65. 10 - 1 = 9 won't work, but 10 / 1 = 10 which is close.
However, 10 is not available. 
Using 14 as it is, I can subtract 10 from 88 to get 78. 
Now I need 32 more to get to 64, so I'll take 78 - 32, but 32 is not available either.
The available number 10 can be manipulated, trying division or multiplication with another number. 
Dividing 78 by 10 gives 7.8, and multiplying to get further away or getting 64 doesn't work directly with the numbers we have.
Next, observe that 88 can't be manipulated more precisely given we only have 10 and 14. So let's try another combination.
88 - 14 gives 74, and 74 - 10 actually gives 64. Bingo!
Therefore, the equation becomes 88 - 14 - 10 = 64.
</think>
<answer>88 - 14 - 10</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers and try to find a combination that could give us 18:
- 71 and 62 can be easily reduced by subtraction or division but these would result in large numbers, not 18.
- Using 2 with the other numbers would ideally be the simplest approach, since 2 can be multiplied or added/inferred in simpler ways.

Let's try: (71 - 62) * 2
- 71 - 62 equals 9.
- 9 * 2 equals 18.

So, the equation is: (71 - 62) * 2.
</think>
<answer>(71 - 62) * 2</answer>

==============
<think> I need to utilize the numbers 32, 51, 84, and 36 to create an equation that equals 29. Each number can only be used once. I should start trying combinations of operations and considering if I can add, subtract, multiply or divide the given numbers to result in 29.
Let's test: Using 32 - 51 + 84 - 36.
1. First, calculate 32 - 51 = -19.
2. Then add 84: -19 + 84 = +65.
3. Finally, subtract 36: 65 - 36 = 29.
This gives us the desired result of 29.
</think>
<answer> (32 - 51 + 84 - 36) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the options we have. Our two numbers 9 and 83 are the ones that give us a chance to make the number 79 using basic arithmetic operations.
9 can be easily subtracted or added to get close to 79. But subtracting 9 from 83 would get us 74, which is too high. So, we subtract 9 from 83 to get 74, and then we need to get from 74 to 79, which is close to 5. This aligns with the other number 83, as 83 - 78 equals 5. Therefore, the equation we are trying to formulate is 78 + 9.
Now, 83 - 9 = 74. We now need to get 5 from 74, and 85 - 83 = 2. So, we add 2 + 85 = 87, which is too high.
Then 86 + 83 gives us 169, which is still too high.
Now let's use the operations we have. Subtracting and adding 86 and 83 should not get us to 79. The only way to get to this number is if we manipulate 83 and 85. 85 - 9 = 76, which is close to 79. To get from 76 to 79, we just need to add 3. And 86 - 83 = 3, which we can add to 76.
So, the equation is 85 - 9 + (86 - 83) = 79. </think>
<answer> 85 - 9 + (86 - 83) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 29, 42, and 5 to make 18. A good strategy would be to use subtraction to pull numbers closer to 18 and then use multiplication or division to get exactly 18.
Looking at the numbers, 42 is quite large and 29 is already quite close to 18, so I'll start by using 29 and 42.
42 - 29 = 13
Now, I want to get from 13 to 18 using 5. Adding 5 would get me closer to 18, so I'll add 5.
13 + 5 = 18
Alright, I've found how to get 18 using the numbers 29, 42, and 5.
</think>
<answer> (42 - 29) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll need to identify a combination that can yield 29 when using the provided numbers 1, 79, 35, and 86. Given that 29 is close to 35, I can consider adding 79 to 35. This gives me an immediate close value:
\[ 79 + 35 = 114 \]
Next, since 114 is significantly higher than 29, I'll need to reduce this value drastically. Seeing that 1 is the smallest number, it might be useful to use this to reduce the 114. Subtracting 1 from 114 gives:
\[ 114 - 1 = 113 \]
Now, I need to get from 113 to 29, so I'll subtract 84. Since 84 is not one of the numbers available, I'll try to form 84 from the operations using the given numbers.
However, the only way to form 84 using 1, 79, 35, and 86 and the allowed operations is not obvious. Instead, I can consider dividing 113 by a number that will bring the result close to 29. Dividing 113 by 4 is too big, but dividing by 4.5 or 4.6 may not yield an integer. Looking at the numbers at hand, dividing by 4.3 sounds reasonable to get close to 29.
\[ \frac{114 - 1}{4.3} = \frac{113}{4.3} \approx 26.39 \]
This isn't exactly 29. Given the numbers available, attempting this conclusion, I realize a different path might be valid. Let's consider an alternate path: if we use the number 35 directly and manipulate it.
If 79 + 35 = 114, subtracting 86 from 114 results in:
\[ 114 - 86 = 28 \]
Now, we need an operation to get from 28 to 29. A difference of 1 can be made by 1:
\[ 28 + 1 = 29 \]
Combining all these:
\[ 79 + 35 - 86 + 1 = 29 \]
</think>
<answer> (79 + 35 - 86) + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target number we need to reach, which is 29, and use the given numbers [1, 79, 35, 86] only once.
One potential approach is to see if we can multiply or add some numbers to reach the target. If we look at 86, it seems quite large, so it might not help us get close to 29 just by itself. Similarly, 79 is quite high and dividing by it or using it alone probably won't get us 29.
4 and 35 would leave 5 as 86 - 4 - 35 = 47, which is too high. Therefore, we might consider subtraction rather than addition. 
Let's try: 86 - 79 = 7. Now we want to reach 29 with the remaining numbers: 1 and 35.
We can consider that 35 * 1 = 35, so 35 + 1 = 36, which is close but gives us 35 too high.
We might consider 35 - 1 = 34 which gives us 35 - 1 - 7 = 27, which is close, but not exactly 29. 
However, we can use 35 - (86 - 79) = 35 - 7 = 28. And finally, to make it 29, we can consider 28 + 1 = 29.
So, the final equation would be: 35 - (86 - 79) + 1 = 29. This uses each number only once and results in the target number 29.
</think>
<answer> 35 - (86 - 79) + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, 95 is quite close to the sum of our given numbers: 50 + 55 = 105. This means we'll likely need to subtract or divide to get to 95. 
Looking at the numbers, 55 seems to be a good candidate to work with since it's bigger than 50 and smaller than 105. 55/5 would give us 11, a number that seems reasonable for this equation.
If we then consider 50 - 11 * 10, it doesn't work. Multiplying 11 by 10 gives 110, and subtracting 50 does not give us 95.
However, 50 - 11 / 10 = 49.1, which is far from 95. 
Instead, we can try 55 - 11 / 10. Working from left to right, first we do division: 11 / 10 = 1. 1. Next we do multiplication: 55 * 1. 1 = 60. 5. Finally we subtract 50 from 60. 5 to get 10. 5.
This too doesn't work since we need to reach 95.
Considering another option, we can use 55 as the base and then use the other numbers in a different way: (55 - 50) * 10. This operation: (55 - 50) gives us 5, and then we multiply that by 10, which gives 50. Thus, to make this sum up to 95, we need to add the remaining 45, but using 5 as is doesn't work there. We consider (50 + 55 - 10), which does give us the answer.
</think>
<answer> (50 + 55 - 10) </answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to create an equation with the numbers 14, 17, and 93 that equals 90. We need to use each number only once and only basic arithmetic operations.
Considering that 93 is significantly larger than 90, subtracting 93 from 90 won't work as it would lead to a negative number. Multiplying 93 by a smaller number won't be enough because 93 is already much larger than 90. Dividing 90 by 93 would give a result closer to 0, not 90.
The number 14 seems more accessible for reaching 90. Using multiplication or division with 17 and 14 isn't ideal for reaching 90 either. However, addition or subtraction involving these numbers could help.
Considering 17 + 14 = 31, which is still far from 90. Now, let's try adding 93 to this sum:
93 + (17 + 14) = 93 + 31 = 124
This is too much, so let's try subtracting 17 from 93 first:
93 - 17 = 76
Now, we can add 14 to get close to 90:
76 + 14 = 90
Thus, our equation is 76 (93 - 17) + 14 = 90.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 17) + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I will look for a combination where multiplication or division might help us reach 100, as these operations can significantly increase or decrease numbers.
Considering the numbers 45 and 41, if we multiply them, we get 1,745, which is too large. If we divide 45 by 41, we get 1.0976, which is virtually zero and not useful directly for our goal.
Now, dividing 45 by 18 gives us 2.5, which isn't a promising candidate either.
The number 7 can be used to either add or multiply. However, 45 * 7 = 315, which is also too big, and 45 - 7 = 38, which is too small.
41 * 7 = 287, which is quite large. Let's consider combining 41 and 7 with another operation.
Considering the equation (45 - x) * (y + 7), since x and y are 41 and 18, we can begin here.
(45 - 41) * (18 + 7) = 4 * 25 = 100.
Let's confirm: We've subtracted 41 from 45 to get 4, and added 18 and 7 to get 25. Multiplying these gives us 100, which is correct.
</think>
<answer>(45 - 41) * (18 + 7)</answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to consider the numbers 63, 90, and 5 and think of how we can manipulate them to get 32. Notice that 63 is quite large, and 90 is even larger. Subtracting these two numbers wouldn't give us a manageable value, so we might want to exploit the number 5.
Let's try to simplify the problem using multiplication or addition that could produce 63 or 90.
90 - 63 = 27, not 32.
This shows that a simple subtraction won't work. But let's try \( 90 / 5 = 18 \), which is close but still not 32. 
Next, consider dividing 63 by 5.
\( 63 / 5 = 12.6 \), still not 32.
We need to think of a way the number 5 interacts with other operations or can be involved in combinations to get to 32. Notice that 63 * 5 = 315, which is far from 32.
But, we need to balance the equation properly using division, so let's try another combination.
Consider subtracting 5 from 63 and then dividing by 90. 
\( (63 - 5) / 90 = 58 / 90 \)
This is not 32. Now, let's try another approach. We'll divide 90 by 5 first and then see what we can do with the result.
\( 90 / 5 = 18 \), and then subtract 63: 
\( 18 - 63 = -45 \), which isn't 32.
We should be careful not to overlook simpler operations or combinations. Since 63 and 90 are quite large, let's focus on 5. If we add 5 to 90 and then divide by 63, we're more likely to get closer to 32:
\( (90 + 5) / 63 = 95 / 63 \), which is not 32.
Actually, we need the reverse:
\( 63 - (90 / 5) \)
\( 63 - 18 = 45 \), which isn't 32 either.
Since subtracting seems to oversimplify and not lead us to 32 directly with further calculations, let's look for a multiplication or combination involving 5 in a strategic way. 
Considering \( 90 - 17.5 \) seems fitting for 32 since \( 90 - 17.5 = 72.5 \), then dividing by 2 would yield 36, but not 32.
Instead, let's try another approach by reconsidering:
Dividing parts of numbers might not be ideal directly, so:
\( (90 - 63) + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \)
</think>
<answer> (90 - 63) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 63, 90, and 5 that equals 32. I should start by looking at the numbers and considering how they can be manipulated with basic arithmetic operations. One immediate thought is that we might be able to use the larger numbers to subtract or divide down to the smaller ones. Since we need to end up with 32, let's consider if we can get there by subtracting or dividing one large number by another and then adjusting with 5.
I'll start by looking at 90 and 63. Dividing 90 by 63 gives a quotient of about 1.43, which is close to 1.5 but not exactly what we want. If we multiply this by 5 (the third number), we get approximately 7.15, which is not 32. So, this approach with division doesn't work out.
Next, let's consider if combining 90 and 63 through addition or subtraction might reveal a useful pattern. 90 + 63 equals 153, and this number is too large, and dividing 153 by 5 gives a large product.
Multiplying 90 and 63 gives a result of 5670, and dividing by 5 gives 1134, far from 32. 
Since none of the above basic operations give a straightforward result of 32, let me consider if there's a trick or rearrangement. The number 32 suggests that we might be able to form a precise result by combining them in a different way.
Now, I'll try 90 - 63 = 27 and then see if there's a way to get to 32 by adjusting with 5, but 27 + 5 = 32, which seems promising. 
Then, I'll verify if we can construct this equation using only the provided numbers. The equation 90 - 63 + 5 = 32 satisfies all the constraints, uses each number exactly once, and results in 32.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 63 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll assess the numbers given: 16, 60, and 35. The target is to get 41 using basic arithmetic operations on these numbers only once. The number 60 seems promising as it's very close to 41, but it's also the largest. 
Considering the possibility of approaching 41 from 60, I can subtract or add numbers. Adding 16 (16 + 25 = 41) could be a more manageable operation than subtracting 19 from 60, which would use the 16 just once and leave 19, which isn't easily achievable with the remaining options.
If I subtract 19 from 60, I have 41 which is exactly what I need. Calculating the third number needed, I find 35 - 16 = 19. 
Thus, the equation is 60 - 19 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 60 - (35 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that results in 61 using the numbers 27, 70, and 3, and each number can only be used once. One way to approach this is to try mixing simple arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider if I can use the multiplication and addition together to reach 61. I notice that if I add 3 to a number and then multiply by another, I might get closer to 61.
If I start by seeing if there's a simple combination involving 3 and another number that would contribute heavily to approaching 61. Since 3 is a small number, multiplication by 3 could be straightforward.
Now, let's see 70 and 27. The sum of these two numbers is 97, which is quite close to 61. Subtracting 39 from 97 (which is 70 - 3) would give us 58, and then adding 3 to get to 61 doesn't work as a direct step. Instead, I will attempt to find a way to use 27 and 70 directly.
One way to reach this is to use 70 divided by 3, which is roughly 23.33, and then adding 27, but this won't give us 61, so let's try a different operation. 
Let's dive into multiplication:
70 * 3 = 210. 
But 210 is too high. Now, let's multiply 27 by 3, which equals 81. If we then subtract this from 70, we get 70 - 81 = -11, and adding 27 to this gives -11 + 27 = 16, which is not 61.
Therefore, I should use division this time around. Let's divide 27 by 3, which gives 9. 
70 - 9 = 61, and this forms the equation 70 - (27 / 3) = 61.
</think>
<answer> 70 - (27 / 3) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target value we need to reach: 61. One approach is to start by attempting to get close to 61 using some combination of the given numbers and basic arithmetic operations. Let's look at what happens when we use 11 and 84:
- We can think of 84 - 11 to get 73, which is close to our target.
- Now, we need 73 - 12 = 61. We can use the elements 11 and 84 to get 73, and then subtract 12.
So, our equation will be: 84 - 11 - 12 = 61.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 11 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number, 61, and figure out how it might be approached by the given numbers (11, 84, 12).
There are a few operations we could use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We can start by combining the numbers in a creative way while keeping in mind that division by zero isn't allowed.
Given that 84 is significantly larger than the other numbers, it would be reasonable to consider using subtraction to reduce it to a level where addition or division with the smaller numbers could make 61.
Subtracting 11 from 84 gives us 73. Now, we need to reach from 73 to 61. The difference is 12. We can achieve this with 12 already present.
Therefore, the equation becomes: 73 - 12 = 61.
As for how we got from 73 to 73 - 12 = 61, we already have 84 - 11 = 73.
Thus, the final equation using all given numbers is 84 - 11 - 12 = 61.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 11 - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target value 75 and the numbers provided - 66, 49, 13, and 27. I'll start combining numbers and operators to see if I can get close to 75.
Let's try 66 - 49:
66 - 49 = 17, which is too low.
Then, I'll try 49 + 27:
49 + 27 = 76, which is close but slightly too high.
Next, I'll consider if I can use 13 in any operation.
Maybe the number 66 can be added to 13 to pull us closer to 75:
66 + 13 = 79, which is too high.
Now, I'll think if I create an equation that uses 27 and 13 to get something close to 58:
27 + 13 = 40 and 75 - 40 = 35, which isn't useful since we can't use those numbers again.
Taking a different approach, I'll use combining 66 - 27:
66 - 27 = 39
Now, I'll consider the difference between the target (75) and this result (39):
75 - 39 = 36
I then try to find a way to get 36 using the remaining numbers: 49 and 13.
Let's try 49 - 13:
49 - 13 = 36
This gets us exactly 36. Now, I can combine all parts:
(66 - 27) + (49 - 13) = 75
</think>
<answer>(66 - 27) + (49 - 13)</answer>

==============
<think> Since we need to achieve a result of 99 using the numbers 43, 42, and 98, I need to consider how to manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic operations to produce the target number.
I see that 98 - 42 = 56. This is a good starting point as 56 is closer to our target 99 than the given numbers themselves.
Now, if I can get 43, it will make it easy to reach 99.
Given 98 - 42 = 56, I can then add 43 (a basic arithmetic operation) to get closer to 99.
So, the equation would be (98 - 42) + 43 = 99.
</think>
<answer>(98 - 42) + 43</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 43, 42, and 98 to create an equation that equals 99. The logical step is to consider if I can use any of these numbers in a subtraction to get closer to 99.
- If I use 98 - 42, I get 56, which is far from 99.
- If I use 98 - 43, I get 55, still not 99.
Neither 42 or 43 alone contribute to 99. Let's consider the remaining operation as subtraction using the last significant number, 43.
- If I subtract 43 from 98, I get 55. Now I need to use the remaining number to get to 99.
- If I then use 42 - 55 doesn't work since 42 is less than 55.
- Let's try 98 - 42 = 56. But we need to adjust to reach 99. By adding 43 to 56, it matches our goal.
Thus, combining these operations: 98 - 42 + 43 = 99.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 42) + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 9, 17, and 38 using basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 46. 
First, consider if the operation can involve all three numbers used individually. The easiest way to combine these is by looking for combinations that can hopefully result in the other number needed (in this case, 46 - 17 = 29, and 46 - 9 = 37). 
Let's start by adding 17 and 38 which gives us 55. We need to get from 55 to 46. By subtracting 9 from 55, we get 46. 
So the equation will be 17 + 38 - 9 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 17 + 38 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the key number we're aiming for, which is 42. The numbers we have are 78, 69, and 33, and each can only be used once.
Let's start trying different combinations of addition, subtraction, and division. We might approach this by looking at how we can manipulate these numbers to reach 42.
- I see that subtracting 33 from 69 gives us 36. (69 - 33 = 36)
Now, we need to go from 36 to 42. Multiplying 36 by 1.1666 (1 and 2/3) is not an easy way to go. 
- Next let's try adding or subtracting 78 to 36 or 69. 
If we add 78 to 36, we get 114 which is too much and if we subtract 78 from 69, we get -29 which is not useful.
- Trying to use 78 separately means we should look for a way to make 78 out of 33 and 69 or 69 and 33. 
Changing 69 to 36 by subtracting 33 would give us one of the numbers needed, and then adding 36 to 78 seems promising.
So, 69 - 33 = 36
Then, 78 + 36 = 114 (this overshoots, so try 78 - 36 = 42)
Finally, let's check:
69 - 33 = 36
78 - 36 = 42
Thus, the solution is creating the equation 78 - (69 - 33) = 42.</think>
<answer> 78 - (69 - 33) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll think about the numbers given: 24, 3, and 80. These numbers don't seem to directly contribute to 59, so I'll consider operations like subtraction and division.
I notice that 80 - 24 = 56, which is close, but not quite 59. Adding 3 to 56 would give me 59, which works.
Therefore, to solve this, I can use subtraction and addition:
80 - 24 + 3 = 59
</think>
<answer> (80 - 24) + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the target number we want to reach: 37.
I'll start by considering the largest number given, 79, and see if I can get close to 37 using it.
79 is quite close to 79, we can subtract 42 from it and we'll get closer to our target.
79 - 42 = 37.
Next, let's verify if we can get 42 using the remaining numbers 45 and 71.
From the remaining numbers, 71 is the largest, and subtracting 39 will give us 42.
71 - 39 = 32.
Now, 32 isn't 42, so let's consider if we can reach 39 with 45 and 71.
If we subtract 45 from 71, we get 26, which is not 39.
However, if we add 45 and 71, we get 116.
Since 116 is way too large and adding these resulted in more than 39, it's clear those two operations can't be combined to get 42. Instead, let's consider another possibility with 45 and 71.
Let's subtract 71 from 116, and then add 45 to get to 42.
116 - 71 = 45.
Adding 45 to it:
45 + 45 = 90, this is incorrect. Let's back off and consider 90 as an intermediate step:
Since 45 + 45 = 90, let's subtract 71 to get 19.
19 - 71 = -52, which is not useful.
I'll try another approach: consider 42 as being composed from smaller parts.
If I subtract 71 by 45, I need to make up for the remaining 26, which means using 45 - 71 + 45 would be tricky as that would equate to 43.
45 is less than 71, and subtracting from 116 gives too big a number.
Since we have no other operations to combine or manipulate these numbers in a straightforward way, the most direct approach seems to be:
Finding a different set or a creative way of using the numbers 45 and 71 together.
Checking a simpler operation: I can use 71 - 45 = 26.
Now we need 11 (since 26 + 11 = 37).
The only way to get to 11 using 45 and 71 is 71 - 45 = 26.
Since 37 = 26 + 11.
And since 26 is 71 - 45, we need 11.
11 can be created directly from numbers or operations, but since we're constrained on using the numbers provided, there is no direct straightforward way.
Realizing that 37 = (71-45) + (71-45) is an error, I'll improvise.
I think a potential solution is 79 - 45 - (71 - 42).
Let's calculate it:
79 - 45 = 34, and 71 - 42 = 29.
Then 34 - 29 = 5, and adding it to our goal number 37 - 5 = 32.
Clearly, creating 37 is not directly possible by the provided constraint.
I'll take another approach: 71 - (79 - 45) equals to 71 - 34 equals 37.
Thus, the equation becomes <answer> 71 - (79 - 45) </answer> </think>

==============
<think> The target number is 92. We're given three numbers: 20, 89, and 23. We need to create an equation using these numbers once, with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the two larger numbers, 89 and 23. Their sum is 112. If we subtract 20 from 112, we get 92, which matches our target. So, we can make an equation like this: 112 - 20 = 92.
However, the challenge is that we have to use each number exactly once. We can rearrange to include all numbers:
112 can be expressed as 89 + 23, so our equation becomes (89 + 23) - 20.
This gives us the equation: (89 + 23) - 20 = 92.
</think>
<answer>(89 + 23) - 20</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 22, 97, and 83 once each to form an equation that equals 36. The key here is to think creatively about which operation might fit the criteria. The number 36 seems to be a good candidate for being close to 97 - 83 = 14. If I add 22 to 14, this might work. So the equation could be (97 - 83) + 22 = 36. </think>
<answer> (97 - 83) + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll assess the numbers available: 5, 67, and 42. The goal is to make 30 using these numbers and basic arithmetic operations. One possibility is to use the smaller number, 5, in combination with 42 and 67 to reach the target.
Let's consider if I can create a value close to 30 without exceeding it using these numbers. Using division, we see that 67 divided by 42 is approximately 1. 595, which isn't helpful for reaching 30. If instead, I use subtraction:
5 - 42 = -37 which is way off. So subtraction isn't appropriate here.
If I now consider multiplication and subtraction:
(67 * 5) - 42 = 335 - 42 = 293.
That's over the goal. Multiplication without other operations is also not effective here.
Let's try addition and subtraction in a different way:
5 + (67 - 42)
Step 1: Solve theparentheses first:
5 + 25 = 30
Thus, we've reached the desired result of 30.
</think>
<answer> 5 + (67 - 42) </answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, I need to find a combination of the numbers 94, 75, and 92 using basic arithmetic operations that results in 77. One way to do this is to consider how subtraction might work since it can make larger numbers smaller in a useful manner.
If I subtract 92 from 94, I get 2. Now I need 75 more to reach 77. Adding 2 to 75 would equal 77. So the equation would be: 94 - 92 + 75 = 77.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 92) + 75 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 76, 94, 99, and 39. We need to find a combination using these numbers, along with basic arithmetic operations, that equals 78.
1. 99 - 39 = 60 is close, but not 78.
2. If we divide 99 by 39, we get approximately 2.53, which isn't useful.
3. Considering multiplication does not seem likely to fit since the operation will typically increase the number, let's try subtraction and addition together.
4. Let's try 99 - 76 and then adding a new number to make 78. 99 - 76 = 23.
5. Now, we need another number to make 78 from 23. Since 39 is available and 78 - 23 = 55, we can add 55 to 23. However, 55 is not available.
6. The only other number left is 94, and we already used 39 minus 76 to get to 23. One way to form 55 is 94 - 39.
7. Therefore, the equation would be: 99 - 76 + (94 - 39) = 78. This works because: 99 - 76 = 23 and adding 94 - 39 to 23 gives 23 + 55 = 78.
</think>
<answer> (99 - 76) + (94 - 39) </answer>

==============
<think> I have the numbers [35, 18, 95, 95]. I need to use each of these exactly once to make an equation that equals 53. 
First, 95 - 95 gives me 0, so that's not helping. 
Then, the large numbers 35 and 18 must be involved. Let's explore these two.
18 - 35 = -17 which isn't what I want.
That means I need to multiply 18 by some number to get a positive contribution.
If I add 18 to 35, I get 53.
So, 53 - 18 would equal 35.
To get 18 from 35, I can deduct 17. That's where the other 95 can help.
Thus, I need to derive 17 from 95. This can be done by 95 - 78, but 78 cannot be derived from other numbers available.
Now, if I use 95 - 78, I realize that I need to derive 78 from 18 and 35 or another way around. 
And indeed, 35 + 43 = 78, but there is no 43 available.
I need to take another route. Another way around is to think, what if I add 95 to 35 and take away 18?
This would yield 95 + 35 - 18 = 112 - 95 which is 17.
Thus, 53 = 35 + 18 - (95 - 95).
This equation gives us 53.
So the equation is: 35 + 18 - (95 - 95) = 53.
</think>
<answer> 35 + 18 - (95 - 95) </answer>

==============
<think> The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 93, 48, and 32 that equals 13. We can use the basic arithmetic operations. If we look closely at the numbers, we notice that 93 and 48 are relatively large compared to 32. Therefore, we might consider subtracting 32 from 93 or 48 to narrow our numbers down.
First, let's see what happens if we subtract 32 from 93:
93 - 32 = 61
But this is still too large, so we can't use this.
Next, let's see what happens if we use 48 - 32:
48 - 32 = 16
This is still too large as well.
We should check if any operation using 32 can help. Let's try using the operation with 48 first:
48 - 93 = -45 (negative)
So this does not work.
Finally, let's use 93 - 32:
93 - 32 = 61
We need to reduce this further. If we add 48 to 32, we can potentially get 80, which, when subtracted from 61, can give us the result we seek. However, let's see if subtracting the total 32 and 48 from 93 can help us:
93 - 32 - 48 = -17
That does not work either.
Another way to approach this is to consider multiplication and division. If we multiply or divide the resulting numbers for 61 from the initial subtraction, we might get close to 13.
93 - 32 = 61. Now let's consider a multiplication and division:
(61 - 48) / 32 = 7 / 32
This does not help as 7/32 is not 13. 
Another attempt might be:
93 - 32 * 2 = 93 - 64 = 29
We need to make 29 fit with 48 and 32 in some fashion. That does not seem to get us there.
Upon reflection, the equation should be:
93 - 48 - 32 = 13
This equation subtracts 32 from 48 to get 16, then subtracts 32 from that 16 to get 13. Thus, the equation is 93 - 48 - 32 = 13.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 48 - 32 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to arrive at the number 50 using the numbers 68, 52, 47, and 81. I observe that 81 can be used less effectively because subtracting or dividing by it might decrease our remaining target. One promising approach is to utilize 52 and 47 to get close to 100 or 50, and then adjust with 68 or 81.
Now, 52 + 47 = 99. This is close to our target. If we can reduce this by 9 to reach 50, we're set. Subtracting 9 from 99 can be done by 99 - 81. But, I need to include 68 somehow. Combining these numbers in an equation, I could use (99 - 81) + 68 - 52.
Let me verify this: (99 - 81) is 18. Adding 68 gives 86 and then subtracting 52 gives 34. This doesn't work.
Another approach is to consider the equation: 68 - 52 + 47 - 81.
Let's check: 68 - 52 is 16. Adding 47 is 63, and then subtracting 81 gives 12. This doesn't work either.
Considering the need to get exactly 50, I try (81 - 52) + (68 - 47). This simplifies to 29 + 21, which gives 50.
This seems correct; (81 - 52) + (68 - 47) equals 50. </think>
<answer> (81 - 52) + (68 - 47) </answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, I'll examine the numbers and the target number, 68. Notice that the target number is close to 55 and 26. This suggests adding and subtracting the remaining numbers might help. 
Looking at the operations, multiplication and division are less likely to hit our target when using such small numbers, so we'll prioritize addition and subtraction.
55 + 26 = 81, but we need 68. To get from 81 to 68, we can subtract 13. 
Now, the numbers available are 24 and 11. Notice that 24 - 11 = 13. 
So the only equation that adheres to using each number once and equals 68 is 55 + 26 - (24 - 11) = 68. 
</think>
<answer> 55 + 26 - (24 - 11) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine 40, 41, and 15 using basic arithmetic operations to get 96. One way to approach this is to try combinations of multiplication and addition since these operations can yield larger numbers, which might help us reach 96 with 15 and 40.
 
First, let's multiply 40 by 40/15:
40 * (40/15) = 96/3 = 32.
This yields the intermediate result 32, which is not sufficient on its own. However, 32 is close to the target. 

I can now use the remaining 15 and subtract it from 96:
96 - 32 = 64.
Hence, my equation is: 32 + 15 = 47, and then using 96 - 47 = 49, which is 96 - 47.
Running through the steps:
40 * (40/15) = 32
96 - 32 = 64
64 + 15 = 79 (This is not 96, I need to try another way)
Revisiting, I can directly combine 41 and 40:
41 + 40 = 81
Then adding 15 to this result:
81 + 15 = 96

This way, I'm directly reaching the target.
</think>
<answer> 41 + 40 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider if any simple combination of addition and subtraction can give me 25. Given the numbers 35, 98, and 88, I should start with the largest number as it will affect the outcome the most. 
If I use 98 as it is, then I need a result of 8 (98 - 90 for 25) by the time I use the 88 and 35. 
Since 35 + 50 = 85 and 85 - 98 = -13 (which is not 8), I can't use 35 or 88 in their current form to get to 8.
Next, I should consider using 88 and 35 directly.
88 - 35 = 53. Now I need to find a way to get -28 from 53 to get 25.
However, doing 53 - 28 = 25 directly, we realize we do not have 28 available in a simple calculation.
Looking at all combinations, there's no straightforward way to arrive at 25 by using 35, 98, and 88 exclusively.
The equation I can construct with these numbers that equals 25 is:
88 - 98 + 35
That simplifies to:
88 - 98 + 35 = -10 + 35 = 25
</think>
<answer> 88 - 98 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 35, 98, and 88 which results in 25, I'll explore different combinations of arithmetic operations.
One sensible approach is to use subtraction or division to manipulate the numbers so they sum up to or get close to 25.
Let's check if we can use 98 - 88 = 10, and then if we add our third number 35, which we would do 10 + 35 = 45, which is too much. So we have to subtract or use other operations.
Next, let's try with multiplication and division. If we take 88 * 0. 25 = 22, and then combine it with 35: 22 + 35 = 57, which is still too much.
The key might be to make use of these numbers more creatively by combining operations.
Considering 98 - 88 = 10. If we subtract a part of 35 from 10 (which would be ideal if that part equaled the remaining value to make the equation simpler), let's see if we can make 25.
We know 35 - 10 = 25. This works, and now we can construct our equation. The crucial part 10 - 25 = -15 and we know 10 comes from 98 - 88 so combining these:
(98 - 88) - (35 - 25) = 10 - 10 = 0.
This doesn't work as we ended up with zero instead of 25. So, I need to rethink this.
Another approach is 35 - 98 = -63 (negative), which doesn't help. However, 88 - 63 = 25, solving our target.
Therefore, the correct equation is 88 - 63 = 25, where 63 is 98 - 35.
</think>
<answer> 88 - (98 - 35) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider if we can use subtraction or division to help us reach 68. Dividing 92 by 30 gives us a significant result of 3.0667, which isn't exactly 68, but will be close if combined with another number. Using 6, I can check if subtraction or addition will get us to 68. Subtracting 30 from 92 yields 62, and adding 6 to 62 gives us 68.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 30 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the numbers 40, 53, and 61 and combinations of basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value of 74. 
Starting with operations that can yield relatively large or small results:
- Multiplication and division could help get a large or small number that fits the target value more closely.
- Addition and subtraction can also contribute, but given the numbers, they might be less effective.
Considering multiplication/division:
- Multiplying 40 and 61 is 2440, way above 74.
- Multiplying 61 and 53 gives 3233, still too high.
- 40 * 53 / 61 = 33.25, too low.
- 53 * 61 / 40 = 80.625, also too high.
Consider addition and subtraction:
- 40 + 53 + 61 = 154, far from 74.
- Subtracting: 53 - 40 = 13, 13 + 61 = 74.
So, the equation that satisfies the condition is: 53 - 40 + 61 = 74.
</think>
<answer> 53 - 40 + 61 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 40, 53, and 61 that equals 74 with each number used only once. I can start by looking at the numbers and their potential use in the equation, particularly focusing on multiplication or addition as they can yield the desired result when used with other numbers.
I notice that 61 and 53 add up to 114, which is close to 74, but it’s too large.
74 is 40 more than 34, which could be the result of 40 - x.
If I use 40 - 53, I get -13, which isn't useful.
Checking another possible addition, if 61 - 53 is 8, we only need 66 more to reach 74.
This means we should try 40 - (61 - 53) = 40 - 8 = 32.
To get 74, I need an additional 42 (74 - 32 = 42).
Therefore, 42 can also be obtained by adding 53 + 61.
So, combining all these parts, the equation we seek is 40 - (61 - (53 + 61)) = 40 - (61 - 114) = 40 + (114 - 61) = 40 + 53 = 73, but we need 74.
Upon reevaluation, the actual equation to reach 74 directly from the given numbers is 40 - (61 - 53) = 40 - 8 = 72, so we see we're slightly off.
However, another sequence could be: 53 + (61 - 40) = 53 + 21 = 74.
Therefore, the final equation should be 53 + (61 - 40) = 74.
</think>
<answer> 53 + (61 - 40) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the possible combinations. The number 47 is the largest, which makes it a good candidate for subtraction. The number 6 is twice the size of 3, which might be helpful when combined in an equation. 
To achieve a sum of 35 with these numbers, we can set up the following equation: (67 - 47) / 2. However, 67 is not one of the given numbers. 
Let's rearrange the original numbers. If we take 67 - 47, we get 20. Now, we need 15 more to get 35. 
Since 6 cannot be divided evenly to get 15, let's consider another approach: if we subtract 6 from 47, we get 41, which is close to our target. Now, to get from 41 to 35, we can subtract 6 again. 
Thus, the equation would be (47 - 6 - 6).
</think>
<answer>(47 - 6 - 6)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 4, 41, and 28 to get 73. 
I notice that 41 and 28 are relatively close together and adding or subtracting a small number like 4 from one of these could help.
Let's try subtracting 4 from 41:
41 - 4 = 37
Now we have 37 and 28 to work with.
Next, I can add 28 to 37 to get:
37 + 28 = 65
Now we need to get from 65 to 73, so I can add 4 to 65:
65 + 4 = 69
But we need 73, so let's try a different approach. If I subtract 4 from 73, I get:
73 - 4 = 69
This means we need to work backwards. We already have 41 + 28 = 69.
Now, subtracting 4 from 41 to get 37, we can see this completes one path: 41 - 4 = 37.
Finally, adding 41 + 37 = 78, which isn't 73, so there must be an error in my thought process. Let's re-examine the possibility of using the 4 in different ways.
Subtracting 4 from 41 gives us 37, and we need one more to reach 73.
Since 41 + 28 = 69, and 73 - 69 = 4, we can use the 4 directly. 
So, the calculation would be 41 + 28 + 4 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 41 + 28 + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 92, 97, and 53 to get to 58. Let's start by seeing if there's a way to reach 58 using just two of the numbers.
- If I use 97 and 53, I can do 97 - 53 = 44, which is close but not 58. Let's try adding some numbers.
- If I use only 92, subtracting or adding doesn't seem to bring me to 58 either.
- Now, let's consider a combination of two or all three of these numbers.
- Considering the equation (97 - 53) + 92 = 44 + 92 = 136, which is too large. 
- Next, let's try (97 - 92) + 53 = 5 + 53 = 58. This looks promising!
So the equation using all three numbers (97 - 92) + 53 equals 58.
</think>
<answer>(97 - 92) + 53</answer>

==============
<think> Starting with the numbers 81, 11, and 19, we need to combine them using basic arithmetic operations to result in 89.
First, let's see if subtraction between some of these numbers can get us close to 89.
81 - 11 = 70
This brings us closer, but we are still 19 short. Now, we can consider seeing what happens when we do an addition step with 19.
70 + 19 = 89
Looking at the sequence, we can see that this uses all the numbers exactly once and the operations in the correct order to achieve 89.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 11 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and operations in a strategic way to arrive at 55. The number 55 is close to the sum of 83 and 27, which is 110. This suggests we need a division by 2.
83 - 27 = 56
56 / 2 = 28
We are close, but need to add 27 to get 55.
So, 28 + 27 = 55.
Now, to get 28, we can use 83 - 55.
Thus, the equation is: 83 - 55 + 27 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 55 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 34, 41, and 80 that equals 87. I should try to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
Starting with addition, 34 + 41 equals 75, which is close, but not enough. Adding 80 would exceed 87. 
Trying multiplication, 34 * 41 equals 1394, which is far too large.
So, subtracting or adding the numbers from each other might be necessary.
Subtracting 41 from 80 gives 39, which is still less than 87. If I add 34 to 39, I get 73, which is still not 87.
Trying 41 - 34 gives 7, and if I add this to 80, I get 87. This sums up exactly to what I need.
Therefore, the equation is 41 - 34 + 80 = 87.
</think>
<answer> (41 - 34) + 80 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the three numbers we have: 30, 75, and 20. Our goal is to use these numbers in a way that when combined with basic arithmetic operations, we get the result of 85.
Let's analyze the numbers:
- 75 is a large number.
- 30 seems a bit smaller.
- 20 is also a smaller number.
We should first explore combinations that can make the largest possible number since 75 is the largest number.
Considering addition, to maximize this number, we should add 75 and 30. That gives us 105.
Now we have to use the last number, 20, to make the balance. The only feasible way to do this is subtracting 20 from 105.
So, the equation becomes: 75 + 30 - 20.
Now let's calculate this: 75 + 30 equals 105, and then subtracting 20 from 105 gets us 85.
</think>
<answer> 75 + 30 - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 78 using the numbers [29, 78, 30] exactly once, with the operations allowed being +, -, *, /, I should first consider how these numbers relate to 78.
The number 78 is close to 78 itself, which suggests using 78 as one of the values or potentially through multiplication or division.
Looking at the numbers: 78 is already part of the set, and 29 + 30 equals 59, which is not 78.
Multiplication 78 * 30 = 2340 is too large, and 30 * 29 = 870 is also too large.
Division 78 / 29 = 2. 69... and 30 / 29 = 1. 03, both are not integers and don't provide a useful result.
The only remaining operation that looks promising is addition and subtraction but combining 29 and 30 directly does not work (29 + 30 = 59).
However, if I consider the possibility of rearranging with the operations, 78 - 29 equals 49, which is very close but not 78.
I am now considering the possibility of 78 * (30 - 29), which would give 78 * 1 = 78.
So the idea of forming 78 using these numbers and standard operations is possible and follows the constraint of using all numbers exactly once with only one operation.
</think>
<answer> 78 * (30 - 29) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use each number from the list [69, 67, 78] exactly once to get a result of 76. The operations I can use are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, I'll consider the largest number, 78, to see if I can get closer to 76.
If I subtract 69 from 78, I get 9.
Now I need to get from 9 to 76, and I have 67 left.
To get 76 from 9, one way is to add 67.
So the equation becomes: 78 - 69 + 67 = 76.
</think>
<answer> (78 - 69) + 67 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get close to 89 using the three numbers. The number 83 is very close, so I can start by using 83 as it is. Then, I need to find a way to get from 83 to 89. Adding 6 would give me 89. Now, I need to find a way to get 6 using the remaining numbers 73 and 67.
- Using subtraction, I can get 73 - 67 = 6.
So I have 83 + (73 - 67) equals 89.
</think>
<answer> 83 + (73 - 67) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider what simple operations can be used to reach 36 with the numbers provided: 41, 90, and 13. The target number, 36, is quite close to 41, and using 90 would make the math a bit complicated unless we subtract it. 13 could potentially be added or subtracted from one of the other numbers.
Since 41 - 13 = 28, which is far from 36, let's consider subtracting from 90. 90 - 41 = 49, which is just 13 more than what we need. So, if we have:
90 - 41 - 13 = 36
This fulfills the criteria of using all three numbers only once and results in 36. </think>
<answer> (90 - 41 - 13) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 94, 90, and 77 to create an equation equaling 81. I'll start by looking for combinations of these numbers that when operated upon result in 81. One approach is to consider combinations of subtraction and addition. Let's try to see if we can use 94 and 90 in a way that after subtraction, we can adjust the result to 81 by adding or subtracting the last number, 77.
Consider the equation: (94 - 90) + 77 = 81
Let's break this down:
1) Calculate 94 - 90 = 4
2) Add 77 to the previous result: 4 + 77 = 81
This results in the equation: (94 - 90) + 77 = 81
</think>
<answer> (94 - 90) + 77 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use 84, 3, and 51 to create a result of 99. Let's start by looking at the numbers closely. 84 is a big number, so subtracting it from another number is not likely to yield 99. Multiplying or dividing by 84 won't practically get us to 99 either. That leaves addition and subtraction.

Let's try subtraction first:
84 - 51 = 33 (which is not 99)

Now let's try combining the remaining numbers with 3:
51 - 3 = 48 (which is not 99)

If we use 3 with 84:
84 - 3 = 81 (which is close, but still not 99)

Now, let's consider multiplication with 3:
3 * 33 = 99, which is too large. 

Since 51 is much larger than 3, let's consider the other possibilities: 
51 - 3 = 48 (not 99)
84 - 51 = 33 (not 99)

We haven't used 3 efficiently. Let's try:
(84 - 51) * 3 = (33) * 3 = 99.

This works as it combines all numbers once and gives the required result of 99.
</think>
<answer>(84 - 51) * 3</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the problem: we need to create an equation using the numbers 93, 29, and 50, and we can use arithmetic operations. Each number can only be used once. Our target is to get the result 14.
I'll start by examining the numbers and trying to see if any of them can be combined directly to get close to 14 or if any result from their combination fits what we need.
I notice that 93 is quite large and 50 is close to 50, while 29 is relatively small. So, a combination of 29 and 50 might be useful.
Let's try: (93 - 50) / 29. This simplifies to 43 / 29, which is not close to 14.
Next, I'll consider the possibility of using 50 alone and manipulating the rest. 50 - 29 equals 21. Now we need to manipulate 93 to get close to 21.
Let's see how we can use subtraction: 93 - 21 = 72, which is too large. 
Instead, let's try: (29 - 50) + some adjustment. This would give us -11, which isn't helpful right now.
Considering the larger numbers, maybe a combination of subtraction and addition could work: 93 - 29 = 64, now I need 64 - 50 = 14 or 64 + (some change) = 14.
I recognize that 64 - 50 = 14, which is exactly what we need. So the equation is (93 - 29) - 50, using each number only once.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 29) - 50 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 41, 51, and 77 once each to make 87. 
First, I'll consider if addition or subtraction would be helpful for getting close to 87. 
Adding 41 and 51 gives 92, which is too high for what we need.
Subtracting 41 from 87 gives 46, still not what we need.
Let's consider multiplications or divisions. 
Multiplying 77 by 1.142857 (which is 87/77) would be useful, but we can't use decimals or fractions with the given numbers.
Let's focus on 77 and see what other numbers we can combine with it.
If I subtract 77 from 51, I get -26, which is not helpful.
However, if I add 41 to 51, I get 92. If I then subtract 77 from 92, I get 15, which is still not 87.
But what if I add 77 to 41, and then subtract 51?
77 + 41 = 118
118 - 51 = 67
That's still not right.
I need to reassess. 
If I take 77 from 51, I get -26, which is negative and cannot be right.
Subtracting 77 from 41 gets -36, not helping.
Let's try a different approach: Subtract 41 from 77 first, which gives 36. Then I add 51 to 36, which gives 87.
(77 - 41) + 51 = 36 + 51 = 87.
</think>
<answer>(77 - 41) + 51</answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 31, 49, and 68 using basic arithmetic operations to get 86. Let's look at the numbers and consider the operations:
68 seems like a good candidate to see how we can combine it with the others.
31 + 49 = 80, which is close but not quite 86.
Now, let's add 68 to this result: 
80 + 68 = 148, which is too much.
What if we subtract instead of add? 
68 - 31 = 37
If we then add 49 to 37, we get:
37 + 49 = 86, which is the target result.
So this combination uses each of our originally given numbers exactly once and results in the desired output.
</think>
<answer> (68 - 31) + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to reach 19 using the numbers 72, 90, and 1 exactly once. If I consider using 1 as it is, I will end up adding 1 or dividing by 1 which won't change the number significantly. Given that it's difficult to make use of 72 or 90 for reaching 19 via typical arithmetic operations, I will focus on using 72 and 90 to subtract or add.

If I subtract 72 from 90, I would get 18. Now, the only difference between 18 and 19 is 1. The number 1 is exactly available, so I can add 1 to 18 to get 19.
So the equation would be: 90 - 72 + 1 = 19.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 72 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 52 and 56. Adding these gives 108, which is close to 83 if we subtract 25. We're using each number only once, so 51 and 76 must contribute to the -25 somewhere.
Now, 51 - 76 would give -25, so that fits well. Now, we need to add 52 + 56 to get to 108. So, the equation would be (51 - 76) + (52 + 56).
Simplifying (51 - 76) gives -25 and (52 + 56) gives 108. Adding -25 to 108 gives the result of 83.
</think>
<answer> ((52 + 56) - (76 - 51)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to think about combining the numbers in a way that results in 95 using basic arithmetic operations. I'll start by considering the sum and difference of the numbers.
- Sum: 37 + 92 = 129
- Difference: 92 - 37 = 55
Now, let's consider other operations on these sums/differences to get closer to 95:
- 55 - 34 = 21
- 129 - 34 = 95
Here, I can see that using 129 (from the sum of 37 and 92) and subtracting 34 results in 95. This means I don't need to use 92.
So the equation will be 129 - 34 = 95.
</think>
<answer> (37 + 92) - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> I'll start by considering the target number 72 and the numbers given: 44, 33, and 5. 
First, I'll try to see if any of these can be easily manipulated to reach 72. Adding 44 and 33 gives 77, which is very close to 72, but we're short by 5, which we don't have.
Next, I'll consider subtracting 5 from 77. If I do that, I get 72 exactly. 
Now, I need to construct an equation to get 77 using 44 and 33. Adding these two numbers (44 + 33) gives 77.
Thus, the equation becomes: (44 + 33) - 5 = 72.
</think>
<answer> (44 + 33) - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the given numbers: 63, 54, and 78. We need to manipulate these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 87. 
Given that 63 - 54 = 9, which is close but not exactly 87, I'll try to add something to get to 87. 
Since 87 - 9 = 78, which is one of our given numbers, it looks like adding 78 to 9 could result in 87.
So, 9 can be obtained by the equation 63 - 54.
Hence, the equation we are looking for would be: 
9 + 78 = 87.
</think>
<answer> (63 - 54) + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll try to use addition and subtraction to get as close to 66 as possible. 
The numbers are 47, 82, and 31. 
If I add 82 to 31, I get 113. That's close to 66, but it's already too high.
Next, let's see if I can reduce the value by subtracting 47 from 113 to get closer to 66. 
113 - 47 = 66
So the equation is 82 + 31 - 47 = 66.
</think>
<answer> 82 + 31 - 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 25 and 26. Subtracting them gives me a value of 41, which is too high for our target of 21. 
Next, I'll consider adding or subtracting 72. Since 72 is much larger than 21, neither adding nor subtracting 72 will bring us to our target.
The next best operation is multiplication or division. 
Multiplying 25 and 26 gives 650, which is also too high and won't work. Dividing 25 by 26 also doesn't give us 21.
At this point, it seems using the 26 directly might be required, and considering that 26 is close to 25, we might be able to use subtraction and division together.
If we take 26 from 25, we get -1. Then, if we divide 25 by -1 (which is equivalent to multiplying by -1), we get -25.
Now, if we subtract 25 from 72, we get 72 - 25 = 47.
Lastly, to reach 21, we need to take 47 and subtract a number. The only remaining number we have is 26 and we can use the negative value we got from the subtraction.
If we subtract 26 from 47, we get 47 - 26 = 21, which is our target.
So, the equation is: 72 - 26 - 25 = 21.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 26 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 71, 22, and 51. The target is to make the equation equal 42. We can use basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
We should start by checking if we can derive 42 from these numbers through any operations. 
One way could be to consider if we can make numbers close to 42 through any of the operations and then adjust them. 
Let's try to divide 51 by something to get close to our target. Dividing 51 by 1.2 (which is 22/20) gives us 42.5, which is close but not exactly 42.
Then let's think about how we can make 42 using the numbers 71 and 22. We could subtract 29, which is 71 - 42, from 71 and then try to add 22.
So a potential equation would be: 71 - 29 + 22. 
Calculate: 71 - 29 is 42, and 42 + 22 is 64, which isn't 42. 
Now let's revise it to 71 - 22 + 22.
Calculate: 71 - 22 is 49, and 49 + 22 is 71.
This doesn't work either. 
Now let's try another approach: (71 - 51) + 22.
Calculate: 71 - 51 is 20.
20 + 22 is exactly 42.
So the correct equation using all three numbers once is (71 - 51) + 22 = 42.
</think>
<answer> (71 - 51) + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get close to 23 using the numbers 77, 5, and 95. Starting with 95, subtracting 5 gives me 90, which is too high. If I subtract 77 from 95, I get 18. Now, I need something that, when added to 18, equals 23.
Adding 5 to 18 is exactly 23. So, the equation should use 95 - 77 = 18, then 18 + 5 = 23.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 77) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 37, 58, and 46 exactly once to make 25. 
First, let's consider what combinations of these numbers and operations would reasonably result in 25.
- Adding these numbers together: 37 + 58 + 46 = 141, which is way too big.
- Subtracting any two of these numbers from the third gives 37 - 58 + 46 = 25. This is a valid result.
- Multiplying or dividing any combination of these numbers won't quickly yield 25.
So, the equation 37 - 58 + 46 should give us our desired result of 25.
</think>
<answer> 37 - 58 + 46 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the given numbers: 18, 46, and 91. The target is to reach 63 using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding and subtracting the numbers doesn't seem to get us close to 63.
- Multiplying 91 by any of the other numbers doesn't work either.
- Dividing 91 by 18 or 46 results in decimal numbers that aren't very close to 63.
- Another approach involves mixing the operations slightly.
Let's try subtracting 18 from 46 first: 46 - 18 = 28.
Now, we need 63 - 28 = 35 more. We can get 35 by adding 18 to 17, but 17 isn't one of our numbers. 
- 91 minus 46 is 45, and since we need 35 more to reach 63, it seems combining 91 - 46 and adding 18 would be right.
This means we can use 91 - 46 + 18 to get 63.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 46) + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 55, 23, and 48 to make an equation that equals 80. I'll start by examining the parts of these numbers and trying to form a combination that could lead to 80.
- The number 55 is relatively high, so it's likely that the other two numbers may need to be added or manipulated to reach 55.
- The number 48 is closer to 80, so it might be subtracted or added in a different way to reach the required sum.
- The number 23 seems like it could be part of the operation that shapes the sum to 80.
Considering these, let's think of combinations:
1. If I subtract 48 from 55, I get 7, which is far from 80, so that's not the way to go.
2. If I add 48 to 23, I get 71, still away from 80.
3. If I think about multiplying or combining these numbers appealingly, let’s try 55 - 48 + 23.
   - 55 - 48 = 7
   - 7 + 23 = 30
This is still not 80. 
4. If we consider combining the numbers differently, let's try another way: 
   - 55 - (23 * 1) = 55 - 23 = 32
   - This is good but not quite there either.
5. Finally, I can test this: 
   - (55 - 23) + 48
   This simplifies as 32 + 48.
   - 32 + 48 = 80
This gives us the answer 80. </think>
<answer> (55 - 23) + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 2, 52, and 12 exactly once, with the operations +, -, * and / all combined to reach 76. 
First, note that 52 and 12 are significantly larger than 2, and given the target of 76, it appears multiplication will play a key role here.
Considering multiplication, we can try to see if 52 and 12 can be operated on to get close to 76. Let's multiply 52 and 12 together:
52 * 12 = 624, far from 76.
Now, we can try subtracting or adding 2 to 624 to adjust to 76. This means:
624 - 58 = 76.
Using 52 * 12 = 624 and then 624 - 58 = 76. To get 58, we could use 52 + 6, and since we only have the digit '2' left, let's form 6 using the multiplication of 2 * 3. But we can't use 3 as we only have the digits provided.
Now, if 624 - 58, let's look at 58 - 52 = 6. We need to rearrange 2 and 12 such that we get a number close to 58. Note we can use 52 + 6:
52 + 12 * 2 = 76.
This works since 12 * 2 = 24, and then 52 + 24 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 52 + 12 * 2 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to construct an equation using the numbers 38, 86, and 71 that results in 53. Let's first consider what kind of operation(s) might help in reaching this sum.
- Adding these numbers doesn't easily give us 53.
- Multiplying them won't give us 53 either.
- Dividing is another option, but those two numbers (38 & 71) don't seem to easily divide into 86 in a way that results in 53 when combined.
Considering subtraction, let's explore:
- Subtracting the smallest number (38) from the largest (86) gives us 48, which is close to 53.
Now if we can subtract the next number (71) from 48 to get 53, that would work.
48 - 71 will not give us 53.
But if we modify and think about 86 - 38, the result is 48.
Then 48 - 71 will be -23, which is far from 53.
Instead, let's consider if we can use division: 86 / 1.65, but using non-integer values isn't appropriate.
Given a fresh perspective, if I were to mix the numbers differently, I realize:
86 - 71 = 15. Now, using 15:
15 + 38 = 53.
Therefore, we can use 86 - 71 + 38 = 53.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 71) + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the numbers we have: 9, 58, and 12. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 55.
- Adding the numbers together: 9 + 58 + 12 = 89, which is too high.
- Subtracting 12 from 58 gives us 46, and then adding 9 to that doesn't get us 55.
- Let's consider multiplication and subtraction: 58 * 12 = 696, which is too high.
- Let's try: (58 - 12) * 1 = 46, not what we want.
- Another possibility: (9 + 58) - 12 = 55. This looks promising.
</think>
<answer> (9 + 58) - 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 35, 69, and 3 exactly once to make an equation equal to 37. First, note that 69 is quite large and 35 is close to 37, so maybe subtraction or division involving 69 could help. Using 3, let's see if we can strategically use these numbers.
 Consider subtracting 69 from 35 firstly, but that would give -34, which is not helpful:
 35 - 69 = -34.
 Then, I could add 3 to 35, bringing us further away from 37:
 35 + 3 = 38.
 That doesn't work out either. 
 Let's then consider multiplication or division between the numbers 35 and 69, but since we need a result close to 37 and 69 isn't a reasonable divisor or a multiple of 35, that seems unlikely.
 Now, one thing we can try is subtracting 3 from 69 and then performing an operation with 35. 
 69 - 3 = 66.
 Now, we need to use 35 along with 66 to make 37. A good candidate is subtraction:
 66 - 35 = 31.
 This is still not 37. 
 One last trial, trying multiplication or division on 35 and 3: 
 35 * 3 = 105.
 That's too big and unhelpful.
 The only feasible option seems to be to combine 35 and 69 in a way to make use of 3. Let's try a different combination.
 Since 35 is the closest to 37, if we add 3 to 69, we get 72, which is close. Now, we can look at what operation makes 37: subtraction.
 72 - 35 = 37.
 This gives us the correct result.
 So, the equation is:
 (69 + 3) - 35 = 37.
 </think>
<answer>(69 + 3) - 35</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 98, 49, 29, and 29 to form an equation that equals 49. First, I notice that 49 is one of the given numbers itself, which can be a straightforward start. However, since we need to use all numbers and each number can only be used once, I should consider combining other numbers into the equation.
Let's start by checking if there's a way to use the other numbers to get 49. Given that 98 is quite large, subtracting 49 directly won't work since that would only give us 49 - 49 = 0. We should consider other operations.
Dividing 98 by 29 gives us a non-integer result, so that won't work. If we consider multiplication, we see 98 * 0. 5 = 49, but we can only use whole numbers. A promising combination might be to use subtraction and division.
Considering 29 and 29, since they are the same number, we can use the division by 29 twice. This gives us 49 / 29 / 29. However, this doesn't make sense as we need to use all numbers and 49 is already provided.
Now, let's try another approach: 98 - 49 - 29 - 29. This immediately simplifies to 0, which is not what we want.
A combination that stands out is 98 - 49 * 29 / 29. This manipulates the division and multiplication first, using 29 and 29 again. 
Let's evaluate this expression:
98 - 49 * (29 / 29) = 98 - 49 * 1 = 98 - 49 = 49.
This works exactly, using all the numbers.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 49 * 29 / 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how I can combine the numbers [42, 52, 25] using basic arithmetic operations to get 69. Let's try to break it down.
Starting with 52, I can subtract 25, which gives me 27.
Now I have to get from 27 to 69. I can add 42 to 27, which gives me 69.
So, the equation would be: 52 - 25 + 42 = 69.
</think>
<answer> 52 - 25 + 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider the target number, 54. The combination of 18 and 30 suggests multiplication or addition could be useful.
- If I multiply 18 and 30, I get 540, which is far too large for my target.
- If I add 18 and 30, I get 48, which isn't 54.
- Now, I consider the third number, 10. I see that if I subtract 10 from 30, I get 20. This is a more feasible step.
- Next, I realize that if I multiply 18 and 20, I get 360/6, which is not helpful.
- If I subtract 10 from 18, I get -2, which isn't helpful either.
- Since adding 18 and 20 doesn't work, I can now think about multiplication. I realize that if I divide 30 by 10, I get 3.
- Now, I can multiply 18 by 3: 18 * 3 = 54, which is the target number.
So, my final equation using the numbers 18, 30, and 10 exactly once would be 18 * (30 / 10). Let's verify this: 18 * (30 / 10) = 18 * 3 = 54.
</think>
<answer> 18 * (30 / 10) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target number we need to reach: 92. We have the numbers 72, 25, and 5 to work with. 
To get close to 92, we need a small adjustment.
72 + 25 = 97, which is very close to 92 but slightly higher.
If we subtract 5 from 97, we get exactly 92.
Thus, the equation is: 72 + 25 - 5 = 92.
</think>
<answer> (72 + 25) - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, lets consider the numbers we have: 29, 66, and 81. We need to create an equation that results in 14 using these numbers exactly once and only the basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by adding two numbers together to get closer to 14, and see if we can balance by subtracting something.
- Adding 29 and 81 gives us 110. This is too high.
- Adding 66 and 29 gives us 95. This is also too high.
- Adding 66 and 81 gives us 147. This is significantly too high.
Next, let's consider subtracting.
- Subtracting 29 from 81 gives us 52. 
- Now we need to reduce 52 to 14. 
- Taking 66 and subtracting 52 gives us 14.
So, the equation should be 66 - 81 + 29 = 14.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 81 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> To get a result of 77 using the numbers 42, 4, 15, and 80 only once each, I'll first consider what kind of equation might work. Since 80 seems too large to subtract or divide away, I'll consider multiplication or division that could reduce it to a more manageable size.
Starting with 80, I can try dividing by 4 to see if I can get closer to 77:
80 ÷ 4 = 20
Now my equation looks like 42 + 15 + 20. Let's check if that equals 77:
42 + 15 + 20 = 77
This works! So the equation is 42 + 15 + (80 ÷ 4).
</think>
<answer> (42 + 15 + (80 / 4)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider all the possibilities with the given numbers (17, 13, 15) and the operations we can use. I'll start by checking if any simple operations involving the numbers themselves give us 15:
- 17 + 13 - 15 = 15 (This works!)
We found a combination here. So, 17 + 13 - 15 equals 15.
</think>
<answer> (17 + 13) - 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 1, 84, and 1 that can produce 82 when combined with basic arithmetic operations.
- 84 is a significant number and far from 82, so it likely won't be used directly.
- The target number is 82 which is very close to 84, and we can subtract 2 to get 82.
- Now, thinking about 1 and 84 - the only arithmetic operation that can cross these numbers is multiplication. 84 * 1 is 84, which is still to far off from 82.
- If we use division instead, 84 / 1 is 84, which is also not useful.
- So, subtracting 2 from 84 would give us 82 directly, but we only have the number 1.
- We can think of 1 as a multiplier or subtractor. Since 1 * 1 = 1, we can consider using subtraction of 1 from 1 or dividing 1 by 1.
- The only viable option here is 1 - 1 = 0, which won't help.
- The subtraction of 1 from 84 gives us 83, which is not the target.
- So, let's re-evaluate and consider combining 1 and 84 in a different way.
- We can express 84 as (1 + 83), 83 is very close to 82.
- Subtracting 2 from 83 gives us 81, not 82.
- Thinking once more:
  - 84 - 1 = 83, not 82.
  - 1 - 1 = 0, not 82.
  - 1 + 84 = 85, not 82.
- Finally, we realize the trick:
  - (84 - 1) - 1 = 82.
- Therefore, the combination is: 84 - 1 - 1 which equals 82.
</think>
<answer> (84 - 1 - 1) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to arrive at the number 82 using the numbers 1, 84, and 1. 
Since 84 is quite far from 82, subtracting 84 from the target number (82) will give me -2. 
Now, I have the numbers -2 and 1. 
To get -2, I can use the number 1 with subtraction (1 - 1 = 0), but this is not enough.
So, I subtract 1 from 84 to get 83, which is closer to 82.
Thus, I have 83 and 1, and I need to use subtraction (83 - 1 = 82).
So the equation will be: 84 - 1 - 1 = 82.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 1 - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 7, 42, and 60. We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 25.
Starting with addition or subtraction seems to not simplify things quickly. Let's try multiplication or division first.
Given the numbers, multiplication by 60 or division by 7 or 42 might not yield simple answers quickly.
Considering division, 42 / 60 gives 0.7. This isn't close to 25.
We could try 60 - 42 = 18. Still far from 25.
Then, 7 + 18 = 25. That is close and uses only the numbers given once. 
Therefore, we can form the equation: 7 + (60 - 42) = 25.
</think>
<answer> 7 + (60 - 42) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider adding and subtracting the numbers to see if I can get close to 93.
Let me try: 46 + 25 = 71, which is still far from 93. Let's try subtracting 22 instead.
46 + 25 - 22 = 49. This is closer but still not 93.
Next, let's try adding 22 to the result of 46 + 25.
(46 + 25) + 22 = 93.
So, the equation is 46 + 25 + 22 = 93.
</think>
<answer> (46 + 25) + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 41, 51, 85, and 23. We need to form an equation that equals 30 using these numbers only once.
Let's start by trying combinations of addition and subtraction:
- 85 + 51 - 41 - 23 = 133 (too large)
- 85 + 41 - 51 - 23 = 52 (too large)
- 85 + 51 - 41 + 23 = 118 (too large)
- 85 + 41 + 51 - 23 = 154 (too large)
Now let's try products and division:
- 41 * 51 / 85 - 23 = 24.32 (not an integer)
- 41 * 23 / 51 - 85 = -21.51 (not 30)
Let's try another combination:
- 85 - 51 + 23 - 41 = 16 (too small)
Now let's try 51 + 41 - (85 - 23) = 51 + 41 - 62 = 30. This works!
So, the equation is 51 + 41 - (85 - 23) = 30. </think>
<answer> 51 + 41 - (85 - 23) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 35, 50, and 84 in a way that results in 69. I'll start by considering how I can manipulate numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get close to 69.
Firstly, 50 and 84 are far from 69, so I'll consider using them in conjunction with 35.
Let's try to subtract 35 from 50 and then add that to 84.
50 - 35 = 15
Now I add this to 84.
15 + 84 = 99
99 is too high, so I need to do a subtraction. I can subtract 35 from 99, but I need it to be 69.
99 - 35 = 64
Now, to get down from 64 to 69, I need to add 5.
Therefore, 64 + 5 equals 69.
So, the equation becomes: 
84 - 50 + 35 = 69
</think>
<answer> 84 - 50 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 61, 79, and 71 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to equal 53.
Let's start by looking at the numbers: 61, 79, and 71. If we subtract 79 from 71, we get -8, which isn't going to help us reach 53.
Let's try using multiplication or division. However, since we are dealing with such large numbers, applying multiplication or division might complicate the solution.
Considering addition and subtraction, one possible approach could be to use subtraction to get closer to 53. If we add a number, we have to compensate for that in another step.
61 - 79 = -18
If we then add 71 to -18, we get:
-18 + 71 = 53
Therefore, the equation is: 61 - 79 + 71 = 53.
</think>
<answer> 61 - 79 + 71 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation with the numbers 61, 79, and 71 that equals 53. I should start by considering which numbers can be combined first to get closer to 53. If I subtract 79 from 71, I get -8. This is far from 53, so it won't help. Let's try adding or multiplying different pairs to see if it gets me closer.
Let's try 79 - 61: This is 18, which is still not 53. Next, I'll consider 71 + 61: This is 132, way too high. Now, let's try dividing 71 by 61: This gives approximately 1. 16, which is also far from 53.
Considering multiplication, 71 * 61 = 4331, which is not going to help either.
Next, let's try subtracting 61 from 79: This gives 18 again, not what I need.
Given that I'm still not closing in on the target, let's consider recombining 61 and 79 with 71: 61 + 79 = 140, which is far from 53, and 140 - 71 is 69, which is still not 53.
Finally, let's try the combination 79 - (61 + 71 - 53): This rearranges the numbers and usage to potentially make more sense.
Let's work this out: 79 - (61 + 71 - 53) = 79 - (132 - 53) = 79 - 79 = 0.
Clearly, this doesn't work. Let's recheck with the correct numbers and operators: 79 - (61 + 71 - 79) = 79 - (132 - 79) = 79 - 53 = 26. 
We are still off target.
Given the need to use all three numbers exactly once, and all failed attempts having led to numbers other than 53, there seems to be a constraint not being fully satisfied here. Considering the direct approach: 71 - (79 - 61) = 71 - 8 = 63, doesn't help. I need to rethink the order.
Let's consider the correct combination: 71 - (79 - 61) = 71 - 8 = 63 is irrelevant for this final solution.
Upon reevaluating, the process reveals the simple missing part in initial assumptions: 71 - 79 + 61 ending the equation to match exactly 53.
Thus, I'll confirm: 71 - 79 + 61 = 53, as per calculations.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 79 + 61 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 22 using the numbers 41, 76, and 13 exactly once. 
First, let's consider what numbers we can generate from the given numbers. 
41 + 76 = 117 (which is too big)
41 - 76 = -35 (which is too small)
76 - 41 = 35 (which is a partial fit)
41 * 13 = 533 (which is way too big)
13 * 76 = 988 (also way too big)
Using 76 - 41 = 35, I could add something else to reach 22.
So, let's try 35 - x = 22, and solve for x:
35 - 22 = 13
This means using 35 as 76 - 41 and subtracting 13 gives us 22.
Thus, the equation would be: 76 - 41 - 13 = 22
</think>
<answer> 76 - 41 - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all the basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The objective is to reach the number 32 using the numbers 78, 16, and 62 exactly once with these operations.
- Consider multiplication and division first because we might get a more manageable intermediate number.
- Looking at 78 and 16, if we divide 78 by 16 we get 4.875 which is not an integer and is not close to 32.
- Considering 62, if we divide 78 by 62 we get 1.258 which is not close to 32.
- Next, I'll consider 62 and 16. If we subtract 16 from 62 we get 46.
- Now, if we divide 46 by 1.875 (this is obtained by dividing 78 by 42.31, but we don't need the exact value to see that 46 / 1. 875 is close to 32) we almost get 24.57 which is close but not exactly 32.
- But let's try a different combination: divide 78 by 62 gets us 1.258. Now, subtracting 16 from 78 gives us 62, and dividing 62 by 1. 258 gives us approximately 49. 57 which isn't close to 32. 
- Instead, let's try subtracting 16 from 62: 62 - 16 = 46. 
- Now we have 46 and 78. Dividing 78 by 46 gives us about 1. 69. 
- We need to manipulate 46 further. If we divide 78 by 62, we get 1.258, so let's use 46 + 1. 258 which is 47. 258 which is not exactly 32.
- Trying 46 + 1 (which is the nearest simplest addition step) gives us 47, and now we need 5 to reach 32. This is not possible with 78 and 16.
- We realize the next best step will be to re-examine the combination 78 - 62 which gives us 16. Adding 16 to 16 we get 32.
So, the equation is 78 - 62 + 16 = 32.
</think>
<answer> 78 - 62 + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 47 and 65 and see if their combination can get us closer to 97.
47 + 65 = 112, which is too high.
47 - 65 = -9, which is too low.
Now, let's try multiplication and division.
47 * 65 = 3055, which is far from 97.
79 * 65 = 5035, which is also far from 97.
79 * 47 = 3713, which is still far from 97.
Now, let's think about combining numbers in different ways:
47 + (65 / 79) = 47 + 0.828 = 47.828 (which is not 97)
Let's try this:
(79 - 65) + 47 = 14 + 47 = 61 (which is not 97)
Lastly, let's try:
65 - 47 + 79 = 18 + 79 = 97 (this equals 97, which is what we need)
So, the equation is 65 - 47 + 79.
</think>
<answer> 65 - 47 + 79 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 47, 65, and 79 to create an equation that equals 97. Let's consider various combinations of operations.
First, I will look at the differences between the given numbers to see if they can sum up to 97.
65 - 47 = 18
79 - 65 = 14
47 - 36 is close to 97 but 36 is not one of the given numbers.
Let's try combining some numbers with arithmetic operations.
(79 + 65) / 47 = 144 / 47 = 3.04 (rounds to 3, not 97)
(79 - 65) * 47 = 14 * 47 = 658 (which is too big)
Now let's try operations on 79 and 47 first:
79 - 47 = 32
Next operations:
32 + 65 = 97
THAT'S IT! We have an equation using 79, 47, and 65 which equals 97.
</think>
<answer> (79 - 47) + 65 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll assess the values and see which combination might yield 89. Given the target number is 89 and the numbers available are 16, 96, 90, and 67, I notice that 96 and 90 have the highest sum and 67 is significantly smaller.
Breaking down the possible sums we have:
- 96 + 90 = 186
- 96 + 67 = 163
- 90 + 67 = 157

Clearly, adding 96 and 90 is too large, so I'll start with 96 + 67 and subtract a smaller value. 
96 + 67 = 163
Now, 163 - 74 should be 89 (since 163 - 74 = 89), and 74 is 90 - 16 which uses all the given numbers only once with minimal subtraction.
Therefore, 163 - 74 = 89 works.
Thus, the equation can be written as:
96 + 67 - (90 - 16) = 89.
</think>
<answer> 96 + 67 - (90 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider the numbers given: 20, 76, and 20. The target is to make 76 using these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
- If I use 76 as it is, the task is to construct other numbers using 20 and 20.
- Multiplying 20 by 20 gives 400, which is too big.
- Dividing 20 by 20 gives 1.
- Adding 20 and 20 gives 40.
- Subtracting 20 from 20 gives 0.
- Adding 20 to 76 gives 96 (which isn't 76).
- Subtracting 76 from 20 gives -56 (which isn't 76).
- Subtracting 20 from 76 gives 56 (which isn't 76).
- Multiplying 20 by 3 gives 60 (which isn't 76).
- Adding 20 and 56 (subtracted 30 from 76) gives 76.
Let's verify with the numbers 20, 20, 30:
20 + 20 + 30 = 70
But we need to use 76, so let's consider the reverse of the last step:
76 - 20 = 56
Now we need 56 using 20 and 20, which we have done: 20 + 20 = 40. 
Then, 56 - 40 = 16 needed to complete it, but we used all numbers so far.
Thus, we can directly consider:
76 = 20 + 56. But 56 isn't directly a product of our numbers,
Let's recheck another way:
(20 * 3) + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80
80 is too high, 76 is still not reached.
Finally, a possible solution is to add or subtract:
76 = 20 + 56 = using 20 + 20 + (76 - 20) = 20 + (20 + (76 - 20)) = 20 + 56 = 76
But using only basic operations and given numbers:
76 = 20 + (76 - 20) = 20 + (76 - 20). 
However, upon rechecking:
76 = (20 + 20) + 36
But 36 isn't formed just from 20 and 20 and other operations.
So, let's reevaluate 20 + 56 to directly use only the given:
76 = 20 + (76 - 20) is directly and fully used.
</think>
<answer> 20 + (76 - 20) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target number we need to achieve: 99.
We're working with the numbers 72, 37, and 64. 
Adding and subtracting these numbers doesn't seem to bring us close enough to 99, so let's consider combining them in a different way.
One approach is to try to use multiplication or division in a useful way.
Let's check if we can use division. Multiplying 37 and 64 would give us 2368, which is too large, so that won't work.
Let's try combining 72 and 64. If we divide 72 by 64, we get 1.125, which is not very useful.
Now let's check the combination of 72 and 37. 
72 + 37 = 109, which is still too large.
72 - 37 = 35, which is not helpful either.
Now let's consider 64 and 37. 
64 + 37 = 101, which is closer but still not 99.
64 - 37 = 27, which isn't helpful.
We haven't tried using division with just 72 yet. 
72 / 37 is about 1.946, also not useful.
It seems that using the numbers this way doesn't get us to 99 easily. Let's reconsider the possibility of combining them in a more creative way. 
Let's check if we can arrive at 99 by arranging these numbers differently. 
We can try a combination that uses the sum of two smaller numbers and the third number.
Let's try: 64 + 37 - 72. 
64 + 37 = 101, then 101 - 72 = 29, which isn't 99.
Again, it seems we need a different approach. 
Let's revisit the possibility of multiplication or division, but trying rearranging the numbers first as we might have missed something simple.
We can solve it by noticing if we can create 99 from a combination. 
Since 72 + 37 + 64 doesn't give us 99, and no other straightforward way with the numbers suggests itself, let's try a different logical approach.
We can notice that 99 is close to 72 and 64 combined. We need just 17 more to reach 99.
We have 37, and 17 can be obtained by 37 - 20. However, 20 is not directly obtainable, so let's look at 64, and 64 - 47 is not 17 either.
The key is to check if we can make 99 directly using these numbers. 
Since we've exhausted straightforward addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we need to think out of the box.
Upon re-evaluating, if we use one of the numbers a certain way, 37 can be used creatively:
37 + (72 - 64) = 37 + 8 = 45.
And we need 54 more to reach 99 (99 - 45 = 54). 
Now, we see that we need 54 using 37 and 72 and 64. 
72 + 64 - 37 = 136 - 37 = 99.
So, the final equation is 72 + 64 - 37 = 99.
</think>
<answer> 72 + 64 - 37 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 24 using the numbers 15, 38, 31, and 30. One effective strategy is to look for pairs of numbers that can easily be combined to approach 24.
First, let's try to use 38 because it’s the highest number and can help us get closer to 24:
38 - 15 = 23
Now we have 23 and we need to get to 24. Let's use the remaining numbers 31 and 30.
If we add 31 to 23, we get:
23 + 31 = 54, which is too high.
If we subtract 30 from 74 (a large number), we might be able to get to 24. But 74 is just a placeholder since we actually need 54.
Let's go back to the pair we have:
23 + (38 - 15) = 46, which is still too high.
Now let's try combining 31 and 30 in a different way:
31 - 30 = 1
Then, we have 23 and 1:
23 + 1 = 24
So, the equation is:
(38 - 15 + 31 - 30) = 24
</think>
<answer> (38 - 15 + 31 - 30) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number, 41, and the numbers available: 23, 51, 32, and 1.
I notice that 51 is close to 41, so I might subtract 51 to get 10 away from 41 and then use 23 to reach the target. Using 32 with subtraction would overshoot, so I might need to use division or addition later.
Let's start with 51 - 1 = 50, which is 9 away from our target of 41, so we need -9.
Now, 50 - 1 = 49, which is still 2 away, so 49 - 1 = 48 is too much. 49 - (-1) = 49 + 1 = 50, which means using -1 makes 50, and now I need to get down to 41 from 50.
So far: 51 - 1 = 50. Let's consider how to get to 41 from here.
49 - (-1) = 49 + 1 = 50, not quite right.
I need to think of another combination using the 23 and 32.
Adding 23 to 50 gives 73, which is too much.
Subtracting 32 from 50 would be 18, and then adding 23 would be 41 - 18 = 23, but we already used 23 and can't use it again.
Now let's consider division, as it might help to reduce numbers faster.
If I divide 50 by 1. 23, it gives approximately 40. 43, which is close to 41. But we can't use 1. 23.
1 divided by 32 from 50 would make 15. 62.5, which isn't helping.
Now, considering multiplication as a last resort:
50 * 1/32 would require 1600, which is far off from 41.
So, the only working option without the need for complex operations is to use subtraction of 50 and addition of 1 to 23.
Here is the final equation:
51 - 1 - (32 - 23) = 51 - 1 - 9 = 51 - 10 = 41
</think>
<answer> 51 - 1 - (32 - 23) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll evaluate what operations I can perform on the numbers to get 24. I'll consider each number alone and in combination with others:
- 24 itself is the target, so no new information comes from using 24.
- 73 and 25 also do not directly suggest a way to get 24.
- Now, let's try combinations: 
  - 73 - 25 = 48 (not 24)
  - 24 + 25 = 49 (not 24)
  - 25 - 73 = -48 (not 24)
  - 73 * 25 = 1825 (not 24)
  - 24 * 25 = 600 (not 24)
  - 24 / 25 = 0.96 (not 24)
  - 25 / 24 = 1.041... (not 24)
None of these direct operations work. Now let's try combinations using two numbers at a time:
- 24 + (73 - 25) = 24 + 48 = 72 (not 24)
- 73 - (24 + 25) = 73 - 49 = 24 (this works)
So, we can use the equation: 73 - (24 + 25) = 24.
</think>
<answer> 73 - (24 + 25) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider combining the numbers in different ways to get close to 43. I notice that 60 is a large number and 95 is even larger, so these won't work well for addition or subtraction to get 43. Instead, I'll try multiplication and division with smaller numbers.
One way to approach it is to divide one of the numbers by the other to get a smaller value and then possibly add or subtract the remaining value.
Let's try 95 / 78. The result of 95 / 78 is approximately 1.2083.
Now, if I subtract this from 60:
60 - 1.2083 = 58.7917
That's not very close to 43, so this combination isn't quite right.
Considering another approach, I'll take 95 and divide it by 78 to get about 1.2083, and then I'll take 60 and subtract this result from 95:
95 - (95 / 78) = 95 - 1.2083 = 93.7917
Still not 43, but it's closer than before.
Finally, let me try another combination:
On dividing 95 by 78, I get approximately 1.2083.
Now I'll subtract this quotient from 78 and add it to 60:
60 + (78 - 95 / 78) = 60 + (78 - 1.2083) = 60 + 76.7917 = 136.7917
This is still too high.
Let me reconsider the original approach closer to 43:
Since 60 - 78 = -18 is far from 43, I'll try mixing numbers differently.
60 - 78 / 95 = 60 - (78 / 95) = 60 - 0.8211 = 59.1789
Still not 43.
Lastly, let me try:
78 - 95 / 60 = 78 - (95 / 60) = 78 - 1.5833 = 76.4167
I need to be closer.
Finally, after various attempts, let me stick to:
(95 - 78) = 17, but that doesn't work.
Trying 60 + 78 - 95 = 43.
So, I'll go with 60 + 78 - 95.
</think>
<answer> 60 + 78 - 95 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers 98 and 91 to get something close to 89, but their sum is 189, which is too high. Subtracting 91 from 98 gives 7, and adding 91 to 82 gives 173, which is also too high.
Next, let's look at combining in other ways: 98 - 91 = 7, then adding 82 gives 89, which is the target number we want.
So, the equation combining these is: 98 - 91 + 82 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 91 + 82 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 93, 71, 12, and 84 exactly once to get 92. Let's start by considering the closest target number we can reach with these numbers.
Looking at the numbers, 93 seems too high, so we might need to subtract from it or use 84. Let's try using 84 and see if we can make something useful with the remaining numbers.
If we take 93 - 84 = 9. Now we need 92 - 9 = 83. This isn't possible with the remaining numbers.
Let's try another approach. We can subtract 84 from 93 and then use the other numbers.
93 - 84 = 9. Now we need to get from 9 to 83 using 71 and 12. We can approach this by adding 71 and then subtracting 12.
9 + (71 + 12) = 9 + 83 = 92.
This gives us the equation: 93 - 84 + 71 + 12 = 92.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 84 + 71 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> To get 95 using the numbers 20, 27, and 88 with basic arithmetic operations, one efficient way is to think about subtraction and addition.
First, consider the closest number to 95, which is 88. Let's subtract 88 from 95 to see what's left:
95 - 88 = 7
Now we have 7 left to reach from 0 with the remaining number 20, 27.
Given that 20 is a larger number, using subtraction again could be a quick way to get the remaining 7 with 20:
20 - 27 = -7
But we don't want a negative result here. Thus, we use addition instead to get a positive 7:
20 + (-7) = 13
This shows we need an extra 4 to reach 7. We can get this by using 27 - 23, but since 23 isn't one of our given numbers, we need to adjust our approach.
Instead, let's consider combining the numbers. We know that:
27 - 20 = 7
So, we can directly use:
95 = 88 + 7
But we already know that 7 = 27 - 20. Therefore:
95 = 88 + (27 - 20)
This simplifies to:
95 = 88 + 27 - 20
</think>
<answer> 88 + 27 - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 21, 6, and 52 exactly once to get 37. Let's start by looking at the target number and the numbers we have.
- Notice that 52 is the largest number, so it can provide a big chunk of the solution.
- Subtracting 52 from 37 gives us -15, which isn't helpful as a standalone number.
- Now, adding 21 gives us 7, and subtracting 6 from 7 gives us 1, which is close but still leaves us with 31 short of 37.
- However, if we add 6 to 21, we get 27, and then we have to subtract 4 from 37 to reach 33, and then we need 4 from 52 to reach 49.
- But we need to find a way using only basic operations and the numbers 21, 6, and 52.
- If we look at 21 - 6, we get 15. Now, adding 52 gives us 67, which is far from 37.
- Trying combinations like 21 - 52 and 6 + 52 results in negative numbers or numbers far above our target.
- Finally, let's try 52 - 6 which equals 46, and then 21 - this does not help as it's still a large gap.
- Considering these options, we should look at 52 - 21, which is 31. Now, we need 6 to reach 37, and the only way to get there with 6 and 52 is to use the 6 as it is.
- Thus, the equation becomes 52 - 21 + 6 = 37.
</think>
<answer> 52 - 21 + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers given: 8, 39, and 24. I need to use each number exactly once and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 55.
Looking at the numbers, 39 is the largest and seems to be the most crucial number.
We could try to manipulate 8 and 24 to add to 39 or to form 55. 
Adding 8 and 24 together equals 32, which is close but not enough.
Subtracting 8 or 24 from 39 also doesn't seem to give us 55. 
Multiplying 8 and 24 would give a larger number, which is not helpful.
Instead, I consider the equation in the form (largest number - smaller parts of the other numbers) = target.
If I take 39 - 8 and then use the result to reach 55 with 24, it makes sense.
39 - 8 = 31
Now I need 55 - 31 = 24, which happens to be the remaining number.
Thus, the equation is 39 - 8 + 24 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 39 - 8 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find an equation that uses the numbers 29, 67, 92, and 19 exactly once to equal 35.
Considering the numbers available, it seems combining 29 and 7 (which isn't directly present but we can use subtraction to generate it) could be a good approach.
If I do 67 - 92, I get -25, which is not helpful.
Next, let's try 92 - 67 = 25. Now I have 25, 29, and 19 to work with.
To get 35, I need to add 10. I can get 10 by subtracting 19 from 29.
So, 92 - 67 + (29 - 19) = 35.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 67 + (29 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 29, 67, 92, and 19. We need to use these numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get 35. 
- Notice that 92 - 67 = 25.
- Now, we need to get from 25 to 35, by using 29 and 19.
- 29 - 19 = 10.
- We now have 25 - 10 = 15, but we need 35.
- We can combine 25 + 10 = 35.
So, combining the steps we can form the equation using the operations and numbers as follows:
(92 - 67) + (29 - 19) = 35
</think>
<answer> (92 - 67) + (29 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 36, 18, and 54 that equals 33. Let's try some combinations:
First, consider division as it can reduce the value effectively:
36 / 18 = 2. This is close but not 33.
Next, let's try combining 36 and 54 through addition or subtraction:
36 + 54 = 90 (too large)
36 - 54 = -9 (too small)
Given that 36 + 54 = 90 is too large and 36 - 54 = -9 is too small, the 18 must be used somehow.
Let's try: (36 - 54) + 18 = -9 + 18
This approach is still not correct. For 33, we can use:
36 - (54 / 18) = 36 - 3 = 33
So we have used 54 / 18 effectively to get 3, which when subtracted from 36 gives us 33.
Therefore, the equation is 36 - 54 / 18 = 33.
</think>
<answer> 36 - 54 / 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider possible combinations of the operations. Given that 33 is close to 35 if we subtract 2, and close to 28 if we add 5, we can start by considering subtraction or addition with one of the numbers.
We have two numbers close to 35 - 73 and 78. If we use subtraction, we might try 78 - 73 = 5, which is not 33. Using 73 - 28 gives us 45, which still doesn't work.
Now let's consider addition and one of the numbers. If we take 73 + 28, we get 101, which is too large. On the other hand, 78 + 28 equals 106, which is also too large.
Considering only subtraction once, we need to use 28 in a way that complements the others. The combination 78 - 28 = 50 is too large, so let's check if we can use division. If we try 78 / 73, it gives us approximately 1.07, which is not useful.
Now, let's check if we can use multiplication or further combinations with addition or subtraction. Multiplying with 78 results in 78 * 28 = 2184, which is obviously not 33.
Given the constraints, we need to use addition in a creative way. We already know 73 + 28 = 101, which is too far from 33. So, we observe that if we can make a large difference, we'll need a way to balance it.
After these considerations, we notice that 78 - 73 = 5. We then have 5 and another number, hoping for a subtraction that will get us close to 33. But 28 - 5 = 23 is far from 33. The idea seems to be combining with a number.
Finally, let's combine these thoughts: if we recall 78, 28, and 73, one number left is 73, and we need to subtract from the total. Using 78 - (73 - 28) = 78 - 45 = 33.
</think>
<answer> 78 - (73 - 28) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 54, 49, and 77 to reach the result of 72. I'll start by checking if any of the numbers can be manipulated by subtraction to get us closer to 72.
- If I subtract 49 from 54, I get 5. This isn't exactly right, but it's getting us closer. Now I have 5 and 77 left.
- Next, I'll subtract 5 from 77 to get 72. So, 77 - 5 = 72. 
Thus, the equation we're looking for is 77 - (54 - 49) = 72.
</think>
<answer> 77 - (54 - 49) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider simple arithmetic operations and try to combine the numbers 54, 49, and 77 to get 72.
I'll start with addition and subtraction, as these are the basic operations we can use with the given numbers.
54 + 49 = 103
103 - 77 = 26
This result is too high. Let me try 54 - 49 + 77.
54 - 49 = 5
5 + 77 = 82
This is also too high. Let's try multiplication and addition: 54 * 77 = 4158, which is clearly too high.
Now let's try a different combination: 54 + 77 - 49.
54 + 77 = 131
131 - 49 = 82
This is still not 72. Let's try: (77 - 49) + 54.
77 - 49 = 28
28 + 54 = 82
This is close but not quite right.
The last way to check is: (77 + 49) - 54.
77 + 49 = 126
126 - 54 = 72
This combination works. </think>
<answer> (77 + 49) - 54 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to look for a combination of the numbers 33, 98, and 91 that can give me 26. One way to approach this is to consider subtraction as it can often lead to a simpler result.
Looking at the numbers, 98 - 91 = 7. 
Now I have used 91 and 98. The remaining number is 33.
To get from 7 to 26, I need to add 19. 
33 can be broken down into 7 + 16. 
So, 98 - 91 + 7 = 16.
Hence, 98 - 91 + (91 - 33) = 33. 
This is not quite 26, so I need to adjust.
Another approach is to see if we can use addition or subtraction differently. Let's try (98 - 91) - (33 - 7) = 26.
98 - 91 = 7, and 33 - 7 = 26. 
So, 7 - 26 = -19. 
This is incorrect because we need something like 26 not a negative number.
Let's try a final approach: 33 - (98 - 91) = 26.
33 - 7 = 26.
Thus, 33 - (98 - 91) = 26.
</think>
<answer> 33 - (98 - 91) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers: 93, 59, and 39. 
We need to create an equation that results in 73. 
Start by looking at the target number 73 and the largest number, 93. 
We can think of subtracting the largest from the target: 93 - 73 = 20.
But we have other numbers to work with: 59 and 39. 
Next, consider that if we could find a way to get 20 from 59 and 39, it would complete our equation.
Combining these numbers, we might try addition and subtraction:
59 - 39 = 20
This gives us a route to our target.
Therefore, our equation can be constructed as:
93 - (59 - 39) = 93 - 20 = 73
This equation uses each number only once and follows the target of 73.
</think>
<answer> 93 - (59 - 39) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll evaluate the operations I can perform with the given numbers: 95, 79, and 43. To get 59, I should consider both addition and subtraction given the range of numbers.
- Subtracting 43 from 79 gives 36.
- Subtracting 36 from 95 gives 61.
That's not our target number. 
- Let's try subtracting 43 from 95 first: 95 - 43 = 52.
- Now, subtracting 36 from 52 gives 16, which is still not 59.
- Next, let's consider multiplication/division: 95 and 36 don't give us 59 with simple multiplication or division.
- The only remaining option is subtraction: 95 - 79 = 16.
- Now, subtracting this 16 from 43: 43 - 16 = 27.
This result is still not 59. 
- Finally, trying subtraction of 16 from 95: 95 - 16 = 79.
- Then, subtracting this 79 from 43 results in -36, which is not 59.
It seems a different combination is needed.
Considering all the possible operations, we should try:
- Adding 79 and 43: 79 + 43 = 122.
- Then, subtracting this sum from 95: 95 - 122 = -27.
That doesn't give us 59.
- The only operation that could work is:
- Subtract 43 from 95: 95 - 43 = 52, then subtract 36 from 52: 52 - 36 = 16, and finally subtract 16 (which is the remaining number) from 95: 95 - 16 = 79, and so on, moving in the opposite direction to reach 59.
The most straightforward way is 95 - 79 + 43 = 59.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 79 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the possibility of using division to get a number close to 38. Dividing 98 by any of the numbers 20 or 80 will not yield 38. 
Then I'll think about subtraction. I can subtract 80 from 98 and see what's left.
98 - 80 = 18
Now I have 20 and 18. I need to get to 38 in total, so adding 20 to 18 will do it:
18 + 20 = 38
So the equation should use these steps:
98 - 80 + 20 = 38
</think>
<answer> 98 - 80 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 98, 20, and 80 to make the equation equal to 38. I'll start by checking the largest number, 98, since subtracting it from 38 is a negative number that would quickly make the target value even less plausible. Next, I'll try using 80, as that's a large number that could potentially contribute to a larger result when combined with other numbers.
If I take 80 away from 98 I get 18. Now, I need to get from 18 to 38, which requires adding 20. Therefore, my equation is: 98 - 80 + 20 = 38.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 80) + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers given: 81, 38, and 4. I need to find a way to make an equation with these numbers that equals 39.
One way to approach this is to check if any of these numbers, when operated on, could give me something close to 39.
Adding 38 and 4 gives me 42 which is closer to 39 than subtracting 38 from 81.
So the equation is likely to be 81 - 38 + 4.
Now, let's work out the equation:
81 - 38 = 43
43 + 4 = 47
This is still not 39, so I'll check if I might have overlooked something.
However, since 47 is closer to 39 than the alternatives, I'll check if I can do a small adjustment.
81 - 38 = 43
To get to 39, I need to subtract 4 from 43.
43 - 4 = 39
Therefore, the equation is correctly formed as 81 - 38 - 4 = 39.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 38 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 39 using the numbers 81, 38, and 4, I need to consider how these numbers can be manipulated with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's look at the possible orders we could use the numbers:
- Starting with 81, we could subtract or add the other numbers.
- Starting with 38, we could subtract or add 81 or add or subtract 4.
- Starting with 4, we could multiply or divide by the other numbers.
Let's test different combinations:
- Using 81 as the starting point: 81 - 38 - 4 = 43 - 4 = 39.
This gives us a result of 39. It seems to work.
So, the equation would be: 81 - 38 - 4 = 39.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 38 - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using 45, 10, and 97 that equals 62. 
Starting with the numbers given, 45 and 10 can be manipulated by subtraction or addition to get a value closer to 62.
First, let's try subtracting 45 from 97:
97 - 45 = 52
Now we have 52 + 10 = 62.
52 + 10 indeed equals 62, so we found our equation.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 45) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 22, 39, and 32 exactly once to make 15. I'll consider various combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
- Subtracting seems promising as it can directly reduce numbers to our target. Let's try 39 - 22 = 17, but this is not what we want.
- Adding other numbers later also doesn't seem to lead us closer to 15.
- Now let's consider multiplication or division. Multiplying combines numbers but there's only one number (22) that makes sense as a multiplier to reach 15: 15 * 1, but 1 is not in our set.
- For division, dividing by 32 won't yield an integer, and dividing by 22 doesn't reduce numbers to 15.
- Multiplying 22 by 0. 625 will get us to the 15 because 22 * 0. 625 = 13. 75 which is close but not 15, and I need to adjust.
- Subtracting 7 from 15 and seeing if the difference can be reached using the given numbers. If 15 - 7 = 8, then 22 - 39 + 32 equals 8.
- 22 - 39 + 32 = 8, and 15 - 8 = 7.
Thus, 22 - 39 + 32 = 15.
</think>
<answer> 22 - 39 + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 45, 92, and 14. We need to make the equation equal to 33 by using basic arithmetic operations. 
We can start by looking at which numbers can be combined to get close to 33. 
If we subtract 14 from 45, we get 31. This is close to 33, but not quite there. 
If we then add 92, the equation becomes 31 + 92 = 123, which is too high.
Instead, let's try combining the numbers differently. 
We can start with 92, and then subtract some number to get closer to 33. If we subtract 59 (which is 92 - 33), we get 33.
So, the equation becomes: 92 - 45 - 14 = 33.
</think>
<answer> 92 - 45 - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the given numbers: 45, 92, and 14. I need to use each exactly once and incorporate the arithmetic operations to get 33.
I notice that 92 is significantly larger than 33, so using it directly will not help. Also, 45 is close to 33 but not enough on its own. Considering the subtraction, I try:
92 - 45 = 47
This isn't equal to 33, but it's a close approximation.
Next, I try:
92 - 45 + 14 = 61
This is also far from 33.
Now, I'll try combining the numbers differently. Since 45 + 14 = 59, which is still not 33, I need to rethink the combination.
Considering multiplication or division:
(92 / 45) * 14 = 29.77...
Still not 33, so I'll focus on combining 45 and 14 with 92.
14 + 45 = 59
And
92 - 59 = 33
This gives me the equation:
92 - (45 + 14) = 33
Now checking it:
92 - (59) = 33
It equals 33, which is correct.
</think>
<answer> 92 - (45 + 14) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 45, 92, and 14 exactly once to make 33. 
First, let's look at the numbers available and the target number. 92 is too large to subtract from the target of 33, but we can subtract it from 45 in a way that gives us a useful number.
Let's try: 45 - 92 = -47, which doesn't help. So that doesn't work.
Next, let's try adding 14 to 45: 
45 + 14 = 59, which is too large.
Now let's consider combining numbers. If we subtract 14 from 92, we get 78:
92 - 14 = 78
Now if we subtract that result from 45, we get:
78 - 45 = 33
So the equation will be (92 - 14) - 45 = 33.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 14) - 45 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 11, 16, and 16 to get a result of 80 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's consider combinations of the numbers and operations.
First, we notice that the number 16 is repeated, so it might be useful for doubling or other operations to reach our target. Let's explore:
- 16 * 16 = 256, which is too big.
- 16 + 16 + 11 = 43, which is too small.
- 16 + 16 - 11 = 25, still too small.
- 16 - 11 = 5, let's see if we can make 75 or 80 with this 5 and the 16.
Adding 11 to the 16 gives us 27, but we need something close to 53 or 55 to reach 80 with the other 16. Let's try combining:
16 * 5 = 80!
We already calculated 16 * 16 = 256, which is too large, and 16 + 16 + 11 = 43, which is too small. So, 16 * 5 seems promising.
To get 5, we can use 16 - 11.
Thus, our equation becomes: 16 * (16 - 11) = 80.
</think>
<answer> 16 * (16 - 11) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers [82, 44, 10] to get 28. 
Looking at the numbers, 44 seems like a good candidate for subtraction from 82 because it's closer to 28.
82 - 44 = 38.
Now we have 38 and 10 left, so 38 - 10 = 28.
So, 82 - 44 - 10 = 28.
</think>
<answer> (82 - 44 - 10) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers [10, 12, 7] and the target number 15.
The goal is to use each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- If I add 10 and 5, it would equal my target number 15, but 5 is not one of the numbers available.
- If I subtract, let's try 12 - 7 = 5, which is not 15 either.
- If I multiply, 10 * 1. 5 = 15, but 1. 5 is not an integer and not part of the given numbers.
- Now, let's try division. If I divide 12 by 10, I get 1. 2, which is not ideal.
- But if I divide 12 by 7 (which is 12 / 7), and then add 10, this might work.
Checking the equation: 12 / 7 + 10.
- 12 / 7 equals approximately 1. 714.
- Adding 10 to 1. 714 gives approximately 11. 714, which is not 15.
- However, it seems I have overlooked the possibility of using 7 multiple times and in different combinations.
Now let's try 7 + 12 / 10: This gets the value of 12 / 10 = 1. 2 and then add 7 which equals 14. 2, not 15.
Finally, let's try dividing 12 by 10 and adding it to 7: 12 / 10 = 1. 2 and then adding 7 gives us 8. 2 - this isn't quite there either.
Given these trials, the correct equation should be using the numbers 12 and 7 in a way that when divided and added gives us 15. 
- 7 + (12 / 10) = 7 + 1. 2 = 8. 2 which is not correct.
But, if I use 12 - 7 = 5 and then add 10, it equals 15.
Therefore, the correct equation is: 12 - 7 + 10 = 15.
</think>
<answer> 12 - 7 + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 3, 2, and 77.
We need to create an equation that equals 82 using each number only once.
Let's start with the largest number, 77. We can see that subtracting 77 from 82 would give us 5.
Now we have 3, 2, and 5.
Next, let's think about how to use 3 and 2 to get a result that, when added or subtracted from 5, gives us 82.
If we take 3 + 2, we get 5.
To get to 82 from 5, we need to add 77 to the result of 3 + 2.
So the equation can be formed as: 77 + (3 + 2) = 82.
</think>
<answer> 77 + (3 + 2) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to reach the number 85 using the numbers 33, 45, and 7. Let's consider the numbers we have:
- 33
- 45
- 7
45 is the closest to 85, so we can use it as the starting point and see if we can add or subtract small numbers to reach 85.
33 is slightly lower than 45, so adding or subtracting it may get us closer.
7 is the smallest number, and it might be needed to complete the 85.
If we add 33 to 45, we get 78, which is 7 away from 85. So, we can add 7 to 78 to get 85.
Therefore, the equation will be: 45 + 33 + 7 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 45 + 33 + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 29, 80, and 16 exactly once to reach the result of 93. 
First, let's consider the largest number, 80. If we use 80, we need to reach 3 from 29 and 16. 
Using subtraction:
29 - 16 = 13
Now, we need 10 more to reach 3, which can be obtained by:
80 - 29 = 51
And then:
51 - 40 = 11 (But this doesn't fit with our requirement.)
Since we can't directly make 10 from numbers 29 and 16, let's think about multiplication or division.
Considering multiplication, 80 * 1. 09375 = 87. 5, which is far from 93.
Now, let's think about 80 divided by something, but it could be tricky with integers.
The closest operation without causing decimal values would be to use 29 and 16 in the right way.
80 - 29 = 51
Once we have 51, we need 40 to make 91, but we don't have 40 directly. Instead, we can try other combinations.
I notice an easier approach using 80 and 16:
80 - 16 = 64
And we need to add 29 to reach 93:
64 + 29 = 93
So, the equation is 80 - 16 + 29 = 93.
</think>
<answer> 80 - 16 + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and basic operations. The target number is 88. If I use 62, it seems relatively close to 88. Subtracting 62 from 88 gives 26. 
Next, I see 50 and 24. 50 + 24 = 74, which is close to 26. This suggests I can perform an operation involving 50 and 24 to get 26.
Considering division and subtraction, I can break down 24 as follows: 24 - 50 * 0. 1 = 0. 24, but that's not useful.
Then, using basic operations and looking back, division provides a simpler way. 24 / 0. 1 = 240, which is not needed.
Let's try 50 - 24 = 26, and see if 26 can be derived from the remaining number. Indeed, 62 - 26 = 36, which doesn't work. 
Now consider using 50 / 24 which equals approximately 2. 0833, and then subtracting this from 62 gives us 59. 9167, which also doesn't help.
Finally, let me try another approach: 50 + 62 - 24 = 88. This seems to work.
This means we need to add 50 and 62, and then subtract 24, which will give us 88.
</think>
<answer> (50 + 62) - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 62, 50, and 24 exactly once to make 88 using basic arithmetic operations. One possible approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's start by adding 62 and 24:
62 + 24 = 86
This is close to 88, so now I need to find out how to get from 86 to 88 using 50. Subtracting 50 from 86 would work:
86 - 50 = 36
That's not what we want, as it doesn't use 50 as part of the final calculation. Now let's try another approach:
50 - 24 gives us 26. Now if I add 26 to 62, it would give us 88:
62 + 26 = 88
This works since we are using 62, 24, and 50 exactly once. </think>
<answer> (62 + (50 - 24)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 11, 75, and 16. The goal is to reach 48 using basic arithmetic operations. Looking at the options, 75 is a bit too large to be subtracted from the sum of other two numbers to reach 48 easily. 
If I subtract 16 from 75, I get 59, which is still far from 48.
Dividing numbers and adding or subtracting 11 may not bring me immediately to 48. 
Now, if I add 11 and 16, I get 27. Now, I need 21 more to reach 48. Checking with 75, if I subtract 27 from 75, I get 48. This works.
So the equation can be: 75 - (11 + 16) = 48.
</think>
<answer> 75 - (11 + 16) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 71, 54, and 10 exactly once with the operations +, -, * or /. To get the result of 27, let's start by considering subtraction as it can lead to a quicker solution.
If I subtract 54 from 71, I get 17. Now I have 17 and 10 left.
If I subtract 10 from 17, I get 7. But this doesn't give me the number 27.
However, if I consider the reverse order, subtracting 10 from 71 first and then subtracting 54 from the result, it works out.
So, (71 - 10) - 54 = 61 - 54 = 7.
This isn't 27, so I need to look for another combination where 10 is used first.
Using 10 in the subtraction, (71 - 54) - 10 gives 17 - 10 = 7.
This brings the number closer, but I need 27.
Let's consider multiplication and division next; (71 * 10) / 54 = 710 / 54 doesn't give 27.
Finally, considering (54 / 10) + 71 = 5.4 + 71 = 76.4 doesn't give the required number either.
I should reevaluate the basic operations and realize I need a different approach:
Calculating thus far, If I add 10 to (71 - 54) directly, it gives: (71 - 54) + 10 = 17 + 10 = 27.
This seems to fit what we want: using each number exactly once and only basic operations.
</think>
<answer> (71 - 54) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 50, 22, and 27 exactly once to create an equation that equals 55. One effective way is to start with larger numbers and work towards the target.
Let's try to subtract the smaller numbers from the larger ones first.
If I subtract 22 and 27 from 50, I get:
50 - 22 - 27
Now let's calculate this:
50 - 22 = 28
28 - 27 = 1
Therefore, 50 - 22 - 27 = 1. This is not giving us 55, so this approach won't work.
Let's try another combination. If we take 50 - 27 and then add 22, we could potentially reach 55.
50 - 27 = 23
23 + 22 = 45
This is still not 55. 
Now, let's explore combining numbers differently. If we take 50 - (22 + 27), we can try:
50 - 27 = 23
Next, to get closer to 55, let's see if adding 22 can reach the target:
23 + 22 = 45
We are still short by 10. 
Let's re-consider the composition. If we use 50 - 27 and then see how far we need to go to 55:
50 - 27 = 23
We need to get from 23 to 55, which means adding 32.
Since 22 is the closest number to what we need, we can see that:
23 + 22 = 45
And to reach 55, we need 10 more:
23 + 22 + 10 = 55
However let's double-check our basic operations to ensure each number is used precisely. Since we need 10 more but the closest is 22, let's start from the target:
55 - 22 = 33
33 - 27 = 6
This does not match any number from our list. Reverting to the most straightforward approach:
50 - 27 = 23
23 + 22 = 45
We need to reach 55 by summing what's left:
55 - 45 = 10
So adding 22 + 10 = 32 to 23 does not fit what we have. 
Finally, we realize the potential we have overlooked:
50 - 22 = 28
27 + 22 = 49
So adding 27 to 28 gets us to 55.
(50 - 22) + 27 = 55
</think>
<answer>(50 - 22) + 27</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider combining the numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get close to 93. 
Looking at the numbers, 95 is significantly larger than 93, so I can't use it in my equation. 
20 seems like a number I might use to get closer to 93. 
Using 53 and 35, if I subtract 35 from 53, I get 18.
Now if I add 20 to this, I get 38. 
I need to get to 93, so I'll need to find a way to get an additional 55.
Seeing that 95 is the largest number and the closest to 93, I might subtract it from 93 to get 5, but 5 is still short of 55. 
Now, looking at 20, 35, and 18, I see that if I subtract 18 from 35, I have 17 left. 
If I add 20 to 17, I get 37. 
Now I need to reach 56 from 37, which is 19 more. 
95 minus 37 equates to 58, which is 2 more than 56, so subtracting 35 and 20 (which totals 55) will give me 93.
So, the equation should be:
(95 - 35) - (20 - 53 / 18)
This simplifies to:
95 - 35 - (20 - 53 / 18)
This further simplifies to:
60 - 20 + 53/18
But that's not correct as per given numbers.
Upon re-checking the possibility, a simpler way is:
95 - 35 - 20 + 53 = 93
Now this equation fits exactly with the provided numbers once we organize the operations.
</think>
<answer> 95 - 35 - 20 + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 42, 10, 1, and 9 that can add up to 60. I'll start by looking at the numbers in terms of how I might reach 60.
Considering that 60 is closer to 42 than to 10, 1, or 9, I might think of subtracting one of the smaller numbers from 42.
42 - 1 = 41
Then, I can see that 10 + 9 = 19.
If I add 19 to 41, I get 60.
So, the equation would be: 42 - 1 + 10 + 9 = 60.
</think>
<answer> 42 - 1 + 10 + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number, 70, and see which combination of the numbers [64, 16, 10] can get me there using basic arithmetic operations.
64 + 16 + 10 = 80, which is too high.
64 - 16 - 10 = 40, still too high.
64 + 10 - 16 = 64 - 16 = 48, not quite right.
64 + 10 + 16 = 80, just as we saw before.
Then let's try other combinations: 64 + (16 - 10) = 64 + 6 = 70. This looks promising.
Therefore, our equation that uses the numbers [64, 16, 10] to make 70 is 64 + (16 - 10).
</think>
<answer> 64 + (16 - 10) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 50, 57, and 53 that equals 46. I can use basic arithmetic operations, and each number can only be used once.
- First, let's consider simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
- Multiplication and division could potentially give us a larger number, which might be hard to reduce to 46.
- Let's try addition and subtraction.
- If I add 50 and 53, I get 103, which is too high. If I subtract 50 or 53 from 57, I still don't get 46.
- Let's try using the numbers in reverse order in a subtraction or addition.
- Subtract 53 from 57 and then add 50: 57 - 53 = 4, then 4 + 50 = 54, which is still too high.
- Rearranging, if I take 53, subtract 50 from it, and then add 57: 53 - 50 = 3, then 3 + 57 = 60, which is too high.
- Then, let's test 57 - 53 = 4, then 4 + 50 = 54 which is still too high.
- Let's try a different combination: 57 - 53 = 4, then 4 + 50 = 54, then realize this is still too high.
- Finally, let's try subtracting 50 from 53 and then adding 57: 53 - 50 = 3, then 3 + 57 = 60, which is still too high.
- After trying all these combinations, I notice the only way to get close to 46 is by realizing I can combine numbers in a specific way that might not be immediately obvious.
- The key realization is combining numbers in a different way: 57 - 53 = 4, then 50 - 4 = 46.
- This works because 57 - 53 = 4, and 50 - 4 = 46.
</think>
<answer> 50 - (57 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and the target. We need to reach 91 using the numbers 16, 6, 34, and 79 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
I notice that 79 is quite close to 91. If I can get 12 from the other numbers, I can add that to 79 to reach 91.
12 can be created by 16 - 6. When I use this, I get:
79 + (16 - 6) = 79 + 10 = 89
This is not the 91 we're looking for, but it gives me a clue. Now let's try:
79 + 16 - 6 = 89
This is still not 91, but it suggests I might be on the right track. Let's modify it by adding another operation:
(79 + 16) - 6 = 95 - 6 = 89
This is quite close, but still not 91. I need to add 2 more to reach 91, and I only have 34 left.
If I can use 34 in a way to easily get 2 more, that could work. I realize:
79 + (16 - 6 + 34) = 79 + 34 - 6 = 113 - 6 = 107
This is too much. Now let's try:
(79 + 16 - 6) * 1 = 89 * 1 = 89
This doesn't work. For another approach,
(34 + 16 - 6) - 79 = 44 - 79 = -35
This is negative. Let's try 34 + (16 - 6) - 79:
34 + 10 - 79 = 44 - 79 = -35
Still negative. Another attempt:
79 - (34 + 16 - 6) = 79 - 44 = 35
This is close, but not 91. Finally, the correct approach could be:
(34 - 16) + (79 - 6) = 18 + 73 = 91
This gives us the desired result of 91. </think>
<answer> (34 - 16) + (79 - 6) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll evaluate the given numbers 35, 72, and 26 to see if any simple arithmetic operations can yield 81. Looking at the options, 72 and 26 are relatively large compared to 81, while 35 is smaller. 
I notice that 72 - 26 = 46. This doesn't help us get to 81.
Now, 81 - 46 = 35. This calculation shows us a way to use the numbers. We have:
72 - 26 + 35 = 81
Thus, the equation using the numbers 35, 72, and 26 to equal 81 is 72 - 26 + 35 = 81.
</think>
<answer> 72 - 26 + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 37, 13, and 34 exactly once to get 84. Let's start by considering how I might combine these numbers. One way to approach this is to see if any of these numbers can be subtracted from or added to another number to get closer to 84.
- If I add 13 and 34, I get 47.
- Now I need 84 - 47 = 37. This means 37 equals 37, so these three numbers already sum up to 84 when combined without any operations. However, I need to use at least one of the operations to demonstrate the problem solving process.
- Let's try combining them with subtraction: 37 - 13 - 34 = -10. This isn't right.
- Next, I try subtraction in a different combination: 37 - 34 + 13 = 10 + 13 = 23, which is still not 84.
- Let's try multiplication: 37 * 34 / 13. Breaking it down further: 37 * 34 = 1258, then 1258 / 13 = 96.23, which isn't 84 either.
- Finally, let's think about using all of them with addition: 37 + 13 + 34 = 84. This is correct!
So, the correct equation is 37 + 13 + 34 = 84.
</think>
<answer> 37 + 13 + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 89, 48, and 62 only once, along with basic arithmetic operations, to get the result of 21. 
First, let's consider what we can do with these numbers:
- If we look closely, we can see that 89 - 62 = 27, which is close, but not 21.
- If we try 89 - 48 = 41, which is further away from 21.
- We need to manipulate 48 and 62 to get a number that, when combined with 89, results in 21.
- If we consider division:
  - 89 ÷ 48 is approximately 1. 832, which is not helpful.
  - 62 ÷ 48 is approximately 1. 304, which is also not ideal.
- Now, let's try a combination:
  - 89 - 48 = 41, which is not the answer.
  - But what if we rearrange the operations? 
  - (48 - 62) + 89 = -14 + 89 = 75, which is too high.
  - (62 - 48) + 89 = 14 + 89 = 103, which is still too high.
  - (89 - 62) - 48 = 27 - 48 = -21.
  - But we need the positive 21, not negative 21.
  - If we reverse the signs:
    - (48 - 62) + 89 = -14 + 89 = 75, which was high.
    - (62 - 48) + 89 = 14 + 89 = 103, which was also high.
Now, let's try a different combination:
(48 - 89) + 62 = -41 + 62 = 21.
This gives us the result we want: 21.
</think>
<answer> (48 - 89) + 62 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 12, 4, and 58 that equals 66. One effective strategy is to look for an arithmetic operation that can combine 12 and 58 to get close to 66. 
12 + 58 = 70, which is too high. 
12 - 58 = -46, which is too low.
Now let's consider another possibility: If I use multiplication and division.
If I multiply 12 by 4, I get 48. 
Then I need an additional 18 to reach 66 (66 - 48 = 18).
This implies I need 48 / x = 18.
Solving 48 / x = 18 gives x = 48 / 18 = 8 / 3.
Since this doesn't give me a clean integer, it seems combining these didn't work. 
However, consider 58 - 4 = 54. 
Then if I add 12 to 54, I get 66.
So the equation would be: 58 - 4 + 12 = 66.
</think>
<answer> 58 - 4 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 78, 19, and 27 that equals 32. I'll consider the order of operations but since the only numbers I have are small, the operations should remain basic for easy manipulation.
- First, let's try subtraction: If I take 78 - 19, I get 59. This is too high for my goal.
- Then I'll try 78 - 27, which gives me 51. This is also high.
- Now let's try 78 / 27. This gives 2.9, which isn't a whole number and isn't close to 32.
- Next, I consider 19 - 27 = -8. This is negative and moves me further from 32.
- However, I notice that 78 - 51 (from 78 - 27) = 27, which is one of my numbers. This gives me an idea of combining different operations.
- If I add 19 to 27, that equals 46. Now subtracting this from 78 (78 - 46) results in 32.
So, the equation that works is: 78 - (19 + 27) = 32.
</think>
<answer> 78 - (19 + 27) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 53, 37, and 67 that equals 23. Each number must be used exactly once.
- First, let's consider that the result is relatively small (23), which suggests we might need to use subtraction or division.
- If we subtract 53 and 37, we get 16, which is too much and adding 67 won't help.
- Next, let's try division: 53 / 67 is approximately 0. 79, and adding or subtracting 37 won't give us 23.
- Now let's try another approach: what if we subtracted the smaller number from the larger number and then operated on the result?
- If we subtract 37 from 53, we get 16, and 16 - 37 doesn't help us reach 23.
- Let's try another combination: what if we subtract 67 from 53 and then see what we can do with the result.
- This gives us -14, and then -14 + 37 = 23.
</think>
<answer> (53 - 67) + 37 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 47, 10, and 98. We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to get a result of 41.
Let's start by adding and subtracting these numbers to see if we can get close to 41.
98 - 47 = 51
51 - 10 = 41
This gives us 41 directly when we subtract 10 from 51.
So the calculation is: 98 - 47 - 10 = 41.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 47 - 10) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 74, 39, and 54 using basic arithmetic operations to get 89. Let's start by looking at the differences between these numbers and the target number 89.
- 89 - 74 = 15
- 89 - 39 = 50
- 89 - 54 = 35
Now, let's consider the differences themselves. If I take 54 and subtract 39, I get:
- 54 - 39 = 15
But this is the same difference we already have from subtracting 74 from 89.
Let's try another approach by combining the largest two numbers and then see if we can get closer to 89:
- 74 + 54 = 128 (which is too high)
To get closer, perhaps we can use multiplication or division. Since the difference between 74 and 54 is 20, let's see if we can use this:
- 74 - 39 = 35
If we could multiply or include another number to get 89, we might find a solution using division and subtraction.
Starting with 54 and 39:
- 54 - 39 = 15
Now, to reach 89, we need 74 to be the key:
- 89 - 15 = 74
This matches. Therefore, the equation should be:
54 - 39 + 74 = 89
</think>
<answer> 54 - 39 + 74 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 39, 75, 22, and 31 to get 61 using basic arithmetic operations. 
Starting with the largest numbers, 75 and 31, we can perform subtraction to try and get closer to 61:
75 - 31 = 44.
Now we have 39 and 22 and the goal is to get to 17 (44 - 27 = 17), as 17 + 39 = 61.
If we look at 39 and 22, we see that 39 - 22 = 17.
Putting it all together, the equation is:
75 - 31 + 39 - 22 = 61.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 31 + 39 - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 6, 9, and 2 to get 36. One approach is to consider multiplication, as it often leads to larger numbers.
- If I multiply 9 by 4, I can get 36.
- Now, I need to figure out how to create a 4 using the numbers 6 and 2.
- I can use the numbers 6 and 2 in a way that adds up to 4. If I subtract 2 from 6, I get 4.
- Therefore, the equation becomes: 9 * (6 - 2) = 36.
</think>
<answer> 9 * (6 - 2) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll look at the numbers 36, 58, and 96 to see if any of these can be combined to get closer to 74. 
- Adding 36 and 58 gives 94, which is too high.
- Subtracting 36 from 58 gives 22, and then adding 36 to this gives 68, which is too low.
- Subtracting 58 from 96 gives 38, and then adding 36 to this gives 74, which is the target.
So, using the numbers 58 and 36, we can get 74 by the operation 96 - 58 + 36. </think>
<answer> 96 - 58 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the equation structure we need to create: we want to use the numbers 63, 41, and 76 to get 98.
- Start by looking at the numbers and what operations could work. The sum of the three numbers is 63 + 41 + 76 = 179, which is too high.
- Let's try to use subtraction first. If we subtract 41 from 63 and then add 76, we can see if we get 98.
  - 63 - 41 = 22
  - 22 + 76 = 98
Thus, the equation using the numbers 63, 41, and 76 to get 98 is 63 - 41 + 76.
</think>
<answer> (63 - 41) + 76 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers available: 44, 3, 90. 
One approach is to break down 44 or 90 into parts that can be combined to get 49.
Notice that 90 - 44 = 46, which is close to 49 but a bit high.
Then, 90 - (44 + 3) = 90 - 47 = 43, still not right.
We need to reach 49, let's try different combinations.
44 + 3 = 47
And then, we need 2 to reach 49, but we don't have 2.
44 - 3 = 41, still not 49.
We can add 3 to 44 and then subtract 5, but we don't have 5.
Let's try 40 (which is 44 - 4) and see if we can reach 49.
44 - 4 = 40
Now we need 9 to reach 49: 40 + 9 = 49.
9 is 90 - 81, but 81 isn't one of the numbers.
Another way could be to use multiplication and subtraction:
44 * 1.25 = 55, which is close to 49.
However, we need integers and only the numbers 44, 3, and 90 are available.
4.5 is not an option here.
The closest we can get with the given numbers and simple arithmetic operations is:
90 - 44 - 3 = 43, which is not 49.
Let's try again with more combinations:
Using 90 - 44 = 46, and 46 - 3 = 43, which was close but not 49.
Checking further, I see:
90 - 44 = 46
90 - 44 - 3 = 43, neither is 49.
We should reevaluate the closest option:
44 + 3 = 47, and to get to 49, we need 2, but 2 is not available.
Revisiting simpler operations:
44 - (90 - 44) = 44 - 46 = -2, not 49.
Finally, considering the numbers given, 44, 3, and 90:
44 + 3 + 42 = 49, but 42 isn't available.
So, I realize:
The correct formation is:
90 - 44 + 3 = 49.

<answer> 90 - 44 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 16, 79, and 27 that equals 36. Each number can only be used once.
- First, notice that 79 is a large number and 27 is a medium-sized number. Subtracting 27 from 79 might be useful.
  79 - 27 = 52.
- Now, we have 16, 52, and we need 36. 52 - 16 = 36.
- Therefore, the equation is 79 - 27 - 16 = 36.
</think>
<answer> (79 - 27) - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 79, and 27. We need to create an equation that equals 36 using these numbers only once, with basic arithmetic operations.
We'll start by examining the possibility of subtraction since we have a large number (79) and a smaller one (16).
If we take 79 - 16, we get 63. Now we're looking for a way to get from 63 to 36 using the number 27.
We can think about dividing 63 by 27, which equals 2. So now our equation is 79 - 16 - 27.
Let's check if this gives us 36:
79 - 16 = 63
63 - 27 = 36
So, the equation 79 - 16 - 27 equals 36.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 16 - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 23, 15, and 46 exactly once to get 38. 
First, let's consider the largest number, 46. Subtracting it from 38 doesn't give us the other numbers we need.
Now, let's try adding smaller numbers. If we use 15, we have 46 - 31, but we only have the numbers 23 and 15 left. 
The only way to reach 38 using these numbers is to subtract 23 from 46 and then add 15. 
So, the calculation would be: 46 - 23 + 15 = 38.
</think>
<answer> (46 - 23) + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 96, 52, 15, and 8 exactly once to get 21. I'll start by considering the numbers and the target number 21. One simple way to achieve this is to understand if any combination of these numbers, using addition and subtraction, can make 21. 
Looking at the numbers, I notice that 96 and 52 are quite large while 15 and 8 are smaller. Let's try subtracting some from others. If I subtract 15 and 8 from 96 and 52, I get:
96 - 15 = 81
52 - 8 = 44
Now I have 81 and 44. To get 21, I can divide 81 by 3. But 3 is not in the list, so let's try another combination.
Instead, let's consider the possibility of a different combination that doesn't involve division:
8 + 15 = 23
96 - 52 = 44
Here, I have 23 and 44. If I subtract 23 from 44, I get:
44 - 23 = 21
This gives me the desired result of 21. Therefore, the equation is:
(96 - 52) - (8 + 15) = 21
</think>
<answer> (96 - 52) - (8 + 15) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the given numbers that add up or subtract to 72. The numbers are 38, 78, 89, and 57.
Looking at 89, it's quite a large number, which suggests subtraction might be the approach.
If I subtract 38 from 89, I get 51. Now, I have 57 and an 78 to add to make 72.
Adding 57 and 78 gives me 135, which is too much. Instead, let's try 78 minus 57, which equals 21.
Now I have 51 and 21. Adding these gives 72 exactly.
So the equation is: 89 - 38 + 78 - 57 = 72.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 38 + 78 - 57 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 67, 20, and 73 that results in 26. The key here is to use each number exactly once and perform some operations.
- First, let's see if addition or subtraction can help. Adding or subtracting these numbers from each other won't give us 26.
- Next, let's consider multiplication and division.
- If I divide 73 by 20, I get 3.65, which isn't 26.
- If I divide 67 by 20, I get 3.35, which also isn't 26.
- But, if I divide 73 by 20 and then subtract from 67, I get closer.
Dividing 73 by 20 gives us 3.65. 
So, 67 - 3.65 = 63.35, which is still not 26.
- It seems I should try another approach. What if I do 73 - 67, and then add 20?
- 73 - 67 = 6
- Now, 6 + 20 = 26.
This works! So, the equation is 73 - 67 + 20.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 67 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> To get 99 using the numbers 43, 99, and 43, we need to consider how we can manipulate these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
One way could be:
1. Start with the number 99
2. Then add 43 to it: 99 + 43 = 142
However, this exceeds 99. 
Next, let's think about subtraction:
3. We could subtract 43 from 99: 99 - 43 = 56
This is close but not quite 99.
Now, let's consider using the remaining 43:
4. If we subtract 43 from the previous result we got, we could try: 56 - 43 = 13
This is not correct as we are trying to end with 99.
Another approach:
5. We could try adding 43 to the result of the subtraction: 56 + 43 = 99
This satisfies the condition of getting 99 using all the numbers with basic arithmetic.
</think>
<answer> (99 - 43) + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 99 using the numbers 66, 41, and 74 exactly once, I need to explore combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider addition and subtraction:
66 + 41 + 74 = 181 (not 99)
66 + 74 - 41 = 99 (This seems to be the right direction)
Checking the other numbers to ensure we're not using them:
66 + 74 - 41 = 99, and we used 66, 74, but 41 is not part of the equation.
So, the valid equation using the numbers is 66 + 74 - 41 = 99.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 74 - 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's identify the numbers we have: 55, 49, and 33. We need to use each one exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations, to get 39.
- We're close to 39 with 49 - 55 = -6, but it needs to be positive.
- If we add or subtract the other numbers, it won't get us close enough.
- Considering multiplication and division, we can calculate 49 / 1. 3 (approximately) which isn't an integer.
- Examining the options, it seems 33 alone doesn't help much when combined with the given numbers.
- Now, let's try a combination: If we use the operations on 55 and 33 in some grouping.
- We can write it as (55 - 33) + 49 = 22 + 49. This calculation results in 71, which is too high.
- Rearranging slightly, let's try 55 - (49/33). Although division yields a non-integer, this isn't fitting our criteria of integers.
- Let's rearrange it in a different way by noticing that 55 - 49 = 6, and 6 + 33 = 39.
So, 55 - 49 + 33 = 39.
</think>
<answer> (55 - 49) + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 14, 92, and 18 exactly once to make 96 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's consider different combinations:
- 92 - 14 does not reach 96.
- 92 + 18 also does not reach 96.
- 92 - 18 gives me 74, which is close but still not 96.
Now, let's try adding the remaining number to one of the others:
- 14 + 92 = 106, which is too high.
- 18 + 92 = 110, which is also too high.
It seems the solution might involve subtraction. Let's try:
- 92 - 14 gives 78, and then 78 - 18 equals 60, which is still not 96.
- What if I use multiplication or division? 
Multiplying 14 and 18 equals 252, which is much higher.
Dividing 92 by 14 equals 6.57 (not an integer), so it can't be used.
It seems the direct combination of these numbers using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication doesn't yield 96.
Revisiting the problem:
Checking all possible operations and combinations again, I notice a mistake in my initial consideration.
Observe: 92 - 14 = 78, and then 78 + 18 = 96.
This combination works! </think>
<answer> (92 - 14) + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 7, 32, and 44 to create an equation that equals 83. First, I'll consider the possibility of using multiplication or division first as they can give us numbers that are easier to add or subtract to reach 83.
- If I take 44 * 2, I get 88, which is close but not quite there.
- If I take 32 * 3, I get 96, which is too high.
- Perhaps I should try combinations of the numbers using addition and subtraction.
Now I consider addition and subtraction:
- I notice that 7 + 32 = 39, which if I added to 44 would be 83, this seems promising.
- Therefore, the equation would be: 7 + 32 + 44 = 83.
</think>
<answer> (7 + 32) + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 89, 4, 82, and 27 using basic arithmetic operations to get 30. 
First, I notice that 89 - 82 = 7.
Next, I see that 27 - 4 = 23.
If I add these results together, I get 7 + 23 = 30.
So, the equation is 89 - 82 + 27 - 4 = 30.
</think>
<answer> (89 - 82 + 27 - 4) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the given numbers 58, 69, and 66 using basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 61. I can start by looking at the difference between 69 and 66, which is 3. Now, the sum of 58 and this difference should be 61:
58 + (69 - 66) = 58 + 3 = 61
So the equation that uses all three numbers once and results in 61 is 58 + (69 - 66) = 61.
</think>
<answer> (58 + 69 - 66) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 24, 97, and 33 exactly once, with each number used only in one part of the equation. 
- First, observe that 97 is the largest number, which might make subtraction from the sum or difference of smaller numbers more likely to reach 40.
- Let's try to form 40 using 24 and 33: 
  - If we subtract 33 from 24, we get -9, which isn't helpful.
- Now let's try to use 97 in a way that adds up to 40 when combined with 24 and 33.
- Adding 97 to 33 gives 130, which is too large.
- Now, let's try 97 - 33 = 64 and subtract 24 from 64: 64 - 24 = 40.
This meets our criteria of using each number exactly once and results in the equation needed.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 33 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 24, 97, and 33. We need to use each exactly once to get a result of 40 using basic arithmetic operations.
- We can start by trying to balance out the sum, as it feels more likely to reach 40 with addition or subtraction.
- Let's try to see if we can get close to 40 with 97 and 33. If we subtract 33 from 97, we get 64. Now we have 24 and 64, and the goal is 40. 
- To get from 64 to 40, we need to subtract 24 from 64.
So, our equation should be: 64 - 24 = 40.
However, we need to remember that we are allowed to use all three numbers exactly once, and we have not yet used 24. So, we need to rethink this a bit.
- Now, let's try 97 - 33 and then subtract 24 from the result.
So, 97 - 33 = 64, and then 64 - 24 = 40.
This uses all three numbers exactly once and results in 40.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 33) - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 24, 97, and 33 exactly once to get an equation that equals 40. Let's start by considering the closest numbers and possible operations.
First, notice 97 is quite close to 100. Subtracting 33 from 97 gives 64, which is too large. Now let's try another operation: dividing 97 by 33 gives approximately 2.92, which is not a helpful quotient.
Next, consider the difference between 97 and 33, which is 64. Then adding 24 to 64 gives 88, far from 40. Subtracting 24 from 97 gives 73, still not 40.
Considering multiplication or division of 24 and 33 is not yielding a useful intermediate step that can help reach 40.
Let me try subtraction between 97 and 33 first: 97 - 33 = 64. This isn't 40, so I need to use 24 in some way.
Now, let's try 97 - 33 - 24. This gives 38, which is close. We need to decrease it by 2 to reach 40. Subtracting 24 here doesn't work, so there must be a different arrangement.
Going back, I spotted an opportunity to adjust the equations differently: 97 - 33 = 64, and subtracting 24 from 64 gives 40.
So, the equation is 97 - 33 - 24 = 40.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 33 - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers 41 and 53. If I add these two numbers, I get 41 + 53 = 94, which is close to 99 but a bit short by 5. I can then use the remaining number, 5, and add it to 94 to reach 99.
So, the equation will be 41 + 53 + 5 = 99.
</think>
<answer> (41 + 53) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination that can produce 91 using the numbers 82, 1, and 10. 
I notice that 82 is quite close to 91, so it might be the result of adding or subtracting small numbers from it.
If I subtract 1 from 82, I get 81. Now I need to get from 81 to 10 more.
10 - 10 = 0, which means adding 10 to 81 will give me 91.
So the equation becomes: 82 - 1 + 10 = 91.
</think>
<answer> (82 - 1) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 49, 3, and 91 exactly once to get 39. Let's try different combinations of operations.
First, 91 is quite large and 3 is small, so they won't easily combine to give 39. Let's consider using 39 directly or as part of an operation.
If I subtract 91 by 49, I get 42, which is not what I need. Dividing 91 by 3 gives 30.33, which is also not 39.
Considering multiplication, there's 49 * 3 = 147, which is too large, and 49 * 1 is just 49, so that's not right.
Using 3 + 49 and then subtracting 91 doesn't work because 49 + 3 = 52, then 52 - 91 = -39, not 39.
Let's try 91 - 49 - 3 = 39. This combination uses all numbers exactly once:
91 (largest) - 49 (medium) - 3 (smallest) = 39.
</think>
<answer> 91 - 49 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 90, 26, 93, and 5, each only once, to get to 34. Let's try different combinations of operations.
First, considering that 34 is relatively close to 90 and 5, let's see if these numbers can help us. 
We can subtract 5 from 90 to get 85. Now we have 85, 26, and 93. 
Next, consider 85 - 26 = 59, which is far from 34.
Now let's try different combinations: 90 - 93 + 5 = -8, which is not 34.
Let's try 90 - 5 = 85, then 85 - 26 = 59, which still isn't 34.
Let's try 93 - 5 = 88, then 88 - 26 = 62, still not 34.
Now let's try another approach: 93 - 26 = 67, and 67 - 90 = -23, still not 34.
Now let's try different additions: 93 + 26 = 119, and 119 - 90 = 29, still not 34.
Finally, let's try 90 - 26 = 64, and 64 - 93 = -29, still not 34.
Trying more combinations: 90 - 93 = -3, 26 + (-3) = 23, then 23 - 5 = 18, not 34.
I've tried various combinations. Now let's try 5 + 26 = 31, 93 - 31 = 62, and subtract 90 gives -57, not 34.
Lastly, trying 93 - 90 = 3, and 5 + 26 = 31, 3 + 31 = 34.
So, the equation is: 93 - 90 + 5 + 26 = 34. </think>
<answer> 93 - 90 + 5 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 40, 63, 81, and 6 that, when combined using basic arithmetic operations, equals 52.
Looking at the numbers, 81 seems too high and 63 is very close to 52, so let's try to use those two to form the number 52.
81 - 63 = 8, which is far from 52. So, 63 - 81 would be negative and doesn't fit.
Let's try 81 - 63 + 6 = 24 which is still not 52. 
Adding 40 to 24: 24 + 40 = 64, which is too high. 
Let's try 81 - 63 - 6 = 12. Adding 40 gives 52.
So, we get: 81 - 63 - 6 + 40 = 52.
</think>
<answer> (81 - 63 - 6) + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 81, 52, and 62 exactly once to make 71. 
First, let's see if I can combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
81 - 52 = 29
29 + 62 = 91
This does not work since it's too big.
Then, I'll try another combination.
(81 - 62) + 52 = 19 + 52 = 71
I have successfully created an equation that uses all three numbers exactly once and equals 71.
</think>
<answer> (81 - 62) + 52 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 83, 81, and 52 exactly once along with basic arithmetic operations to get 50. Let's start by looking at each number:
- 83 is quite close to 82, which is close to 81.
- 81 is directly in the given numbers.
- 52 is a bit tricky, but let's see if we can reduce it.
 Let's try using 81 as our base number and see what we can do with 83 and 52.
 If we subtract 52 from 83, we get 31.
 Now, subtracting 81 from 31 gives us -50, which isn't helping.
 Let's try another combination: 
 If I divide 83 by 52, I get approximately 1.6, which isn't useful as a whole number.
 Now, let's use 52 and 81 in a different way: 
 81 - (83 - 52) = 81 - 31 = 50.
 This gives us the result we need.
So, the equation is 81 - (83 - 52) = 50.
</think>
<answer> 81 - (83 - 52) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 16, 11, and 17 to make 22. 
- Considering addition and subtraction, if we add or subtract the smallest number (11) to or from the sum of the other two numbers, we get:
  - 16 + 17 - 11 = 24 - 11 = 13
  - 16 + 11 - 17 = 27 - 17 = 10
  - 17 + 16 - 11 = 33 - 11 = 22
  - 17 + 11 - 16 = 28 - 16 = 12
- None of these directly give us 22.  
- Considering multiplication and division, let's try:
  - 17 * (16 / 11) is not an integer, and we need whole number results.
- Thus, the only viable operation that provides an integer result and equals 22 is:
  - 17 + 11 - 16
  - 17 + (16 - 11) = 17 + 5 = 22
</think>
<answer> 17 + (16 - 11) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 16, 11, and 17 exactly once to make 22. I should start by considering the numbers and how they can be combined. Let's try addition first, as it's the most straightforward operation.
16 + 11 equals 27, which is too high. 
Now, let's try 17 + 11 - 16: 
17 + 11 = 28, then subtracting 16 gives us 28 - 16 = 12. 
This is closer but not quite 22. 
Next, let's try 17 + 11 - 16 - 1: 
We mistakenly added 1 again, which we can't do. 
Now, let's try 17 + 11 - 16 + 1: 
Adding 1 at the end will give us 17 + 11 - 16 + 1 = 17. 
That's still not 22.  
We can rearrange to see if 11 + 17 - 16 = 22: 
11 + 17 = 28, then subtract 16 gives us 28 - 16 = 12. 
So, we need one more. 
Since 11 + 17 - 17 = 11 + 0 = 11, we need to add a 12 more. 
The only way to make this work is by adding 11 + 12 = 22. 
Since 11 + 12 = 23, we can't use 12 directly. 
Now, let's try 16 + 17 - 11 = 22: 
16 + 17 = 33, then subtract 11 gives us 33 - 11 = 22. 
This combination works! </think>
<answer> 16 + 17 - 11 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 3, 48, and 98 to get 47 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by considering the largest number, 98, as it might help us get closer to 47. 
Step 1: Consider subtracting 48 from 98: 98 - 48 = 50
Now we have 3 and 50, which is not enough to get to 47.
Step 2: Next, consider if we can use 3 somehow. Let's try adding 3 to the result of 98 - 48: 3 + (98 - 48) = 3 + 50 = 53
This is close but not equal to 47. 
Step 3: Now let's try a different approach using multiplication and addition/subtraction: 98 - 48 - 3 = 47
Here, 98 - 48 = 50, and then subtracting 3 from 50 gives 47.
So, the equation that equals 47 is: 98 - 48 - 3 = 47.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 48 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 75, 48, and 83 exactly once to make the equation equal 56. 
First, let's look at the numbers and consider their small differences. The difference between 83 and 48 is 35, and between 75 and 48 is 27. 
To get from these values to 56, we could try adding and subtraction. We can start combining numbers from the given set:
75 + 48 - 83 = 123 - 83 = 40
The result is too high. Let's try another order:
75 - 83 + 48 = -8 + 48 = 40
Still too low. 
Let's now try:
83 - 75 + 48 = 8 + 48 = 56
This gives us the desired result of 56.
</think>
<answer> 83 - 75 + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number we need to reach: 49. I’ll look at the numbers given: 61, 44, and 56. 
Looking at the numbers, 61 and 56 are relatively close to the target, so I'll try to form 49 using these two.
Subtracting 56 from 61 gives me 5. Now, I need 44 more to reach 49, but 44 is already given. 
So the equation becomes: 61 - 56 + 44 = 49.
</think>
<answer> (61 - 56) + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the three numbers given: 61, 44, and 56. We need to create an equation that equals 49 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
- Starting with the sum of the first two numbers: 61 + 44 = 105
- We need to subtract a number to reach 49. Let's try subtracting 56 from 105: 105 - 56 = 49
- This gives us the equation: 61 + 44 - 56 = 49
</think>
<answer> (61 + 44) - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 83, 87, 52, and 63 exactly once to get 55. Let's work through possible combinations:
First, I can see that 87 - 63 = 24, which is quite close to what I need (55 - 24 = 31).
Now, I need to make 31 using the remaining numbers (83 and 52). 
If I subtract 52 from 83, I get 31 (83 - 52 = 31).
So putting it all together: (83 - 52) + (87 - 63) = 31 + 24 = 55.
</think>
<answer>(83 - 52) + (87 - 63)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider all possible combinations using the given math operations with the numbers 4, 20, and 9. I see that multiplying 20 and 4 first will make a significant number that can possibly be adjusted with 9.
20 * 4 = 80
Now, I'm left with the numbers 9 and 80. I need to use these to get to 71. I can subtract 9 from 80 to get closer to 71.
80 - 9 = 71
So, the equation that uses all numbers and gives 71 is 20 * 4 - 9.
</think>
<answer> 20 * 4 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 70 using the numbers 6, 77, and 1, each only once. I notice that 77 is quite close to 70, so I can start by subtracting 77 from 70 to see what remains.
77 - 70 = 7
Now I am left with a 7 to make up the difference. I see that 1 + 6 = 7, which uses the remaining numbers. Putting it all together: 
77 - 1 - 6 = 70
</think>
<answer> 77 - 1 - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 50, 40, and 25 exactly once to get 35. 
First, let's consider the possibilities of subtraction and addition. 
50 - 40 = 10 and 25 - 40 = -15 which are not close to 35.
Let's try combining them with the other operation, multiplication and division.
If we divide 50 by 25, we get 2, which is close but not equal to 35.
If we multiply 40 by 25, we get 1000, which is too large.
The best approach seems to involve adding or subtracting the numbers with a combination of the other operations.
Let's consider 50 - (40 / 25). 
40 / 25 = 1. 6 which when subtracted from 50 gives us 48. 4, not 35.
Let me try 50 - (25 / 40). 
25 / 40 = 0. 625, which subtracted from 50 gives 49. 375, still not 35.
Consider 50 - (40 - 25).
This could work as it simplifies to 50 - 15 = 35.
</think>
<answer> 50 - (40 - 25) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 74, 10, and 38 that will result in 46 using basic arithmetic operations.
I can start by trying to subtract the smaller numbers from the larger ones to see if we get closer to 46.
If I subtract 10 from 74, I get 64, which is too high.
If I subtract 38 from 74, I get 36, which is still too high.
If I add 10 to 38, I get 48, which is too high.
Now, let's try multiplication or division with these numbers. If I take 74 multiplied by 10 divided by 38, I get approximately 19. 47, which doesn't help.
Next, let's try combining numbers different ways. If I take 74 minus 38 and then add 10, I get:
74 - 38 = 36
36 + 10 = 46
This equals 46, using each number only once.
</think>
<answer> (74 - 38) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 59, 54, and 87 that equals 92. The goal is to use each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
I notice that 87 + 59 equals 146, which is quite close to 92. I need to reduce this by 54 to get the answer 92.
So, the equation will be: 87 + 59 - 54 = 92.
</think>
<answer> (87 + 59) - 54 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 80, 69, and 79. 
We need an equation that results in 68 using these numbers once each.
We should check if any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can reach 68.
If we look at the numbers, it seems 80 - 12 will give us 68, but we don't have 12.
The closest number to 12 is 79 - 11, but again, we don't have 11.
However, if we use 80 - (79 + 69) we get:
80 - (79 + 69) = 80 - 148
This doesn't work.
Another combination is 80 - 79 + 69. 
80 - 79 + 69 = 1 + 69 = 70
This is still not 68.
Then consider: 80 - 79 - 69.
80 - 79 - 69 = 1 - 69 = -68
This is not 68 either.
Let's try another approach: 80 - (79 - 69).
80 - (79 - 69) = 80 - 10 = 70
Again, we're not getting 68.
Now try: 80 - (69 + 79).
80 - (69 + 79) = 80 - 148 = -68
This doesn't work either.
Finally, let's use: 80 - (79 + 69 - 80).
80 - (79 + 69 - 80) = 80 - 10 = 70
It seems we're not getting 68.
Revisiting 79 + 69 - 80 gives us: 79 + 69 - 80 = 148 - 80 = 68
So, the equation is: 79 + 69 - 80 = 68.
</think>
<answer> 79 + 69 - 80 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 6, 8, and 66 in some combination to reach 52. Let's start by considering possible combinations of multiplication and addition or subtraction. 
- Multiplying 8 and 6 gives us 48, which is close to 52 but slightly lower.
- Adding 66 and 6 gives 72, which is higher than 52.
- Subtracting 6 from 66 gives 60, which is still higher.
- Another possibility is to consider 66 - 8 = 58, which is also too high.
- Now considering all numbers, I can try 66 + 8 - 6: This equals 68, which is too high.
- Let's try 66 + 8 - 6: This simplifies to 68, also too high.
- Now, let's try 66 - 8 - 6: This simplifies to 52.
So, the equation is 66 - 8 - 6 equals 52.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 8 - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 98, 58, 47, and 33 exactly once to get 26. I'll start by considering what I can subtract from the largest number to get closer to 26. If I subtract 47 from 98, I get 51. Now I need to get from 51 to 26, so I subtract 25. The number 25 can be formed using 47 - 22, but 22 is not in my list. Let's try another combination.
Next, if I subtract 98 - 58, I get 40. Then I need to subtract 14 from 40 to get 26. The number 14 can be formed by 47 - 33.
Therefore, I can use the numbers as follows: 98 - 58 - (47 - 33) = 26.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 58) - (47 - 33) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers [37, 90, 40] that equals 13 with each number used only once, I can start by considering how I might combine these numbers with basic operations.
First, let's note that 90 and 40 are quite large and 37 is small. A combination of multiplication and subtraction seems promising.
- I can try 90 - 40 = 50, but this doesn't get us close to 13.
- Then, adding or subtracting 37 from 50 doesn't quite work either.
Given that 37 is the smallest, I look at the possibility of 40 - 37 = 3 for the next subtraction step.
So, let's consider: 90 - 40 - 37. This gives 90 - 77 = 13, which satisfies our equation.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 40 - 37) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 56, 15, and 95 exactly once to get 54. Let's manipulate them using basic arithmetic operations.
Perhaps we can start by trying to make 54 from 15 and 95. Subtracting 15 from 95 gives us 80, which is too high.
Next, let's consider multiplication: 56 * 15 / 95 gives us 9.23 (not an integer and a bit too complex for one step).
Considering the remaining operations, let's subtract a smaller number from a larger one. If we use 95 - 56 and then subtract 15, we get:
95 - 56 = 39
39 - 15 = 24
This is still not 54. 
So let's try adding 15 to 56: 
56 + 15 = 71
Now subtracting 17 from 71 gives us:
71 - 15 = 56
And subtracting another 15 from 56 is:
56 - 15 = 41
This isn't 54 either but it is getting close. Let's check if something simpler exists.
Let's see if we can make 54 by any combination of these three numbers with the operations allowed:
95 - (56 + 15) = 95 - 71 = 24
Going back to basics, we find:
56 - 15 = 41
And subtracting 56 from 41 is:
41 - 56 = -15
Neither of these are 54.
By now, it seems the simplest operation that gets us close to 54 without making it too complicated involves adding:
(56 + 15) - 95 = 71 - 95 = -24
This is clearly not what we want, so let's reframe: we need a way to make 54. We realize:
(95 - 56) + 15 = 39 + 15 = 54
</think>
<answer> (95 - 56) + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 58, 24, and 9. We need to use these numbers once each to make 43.
We can start by subtracting the smaller numbers from the larger one to see what we get.
58 - 24 = 34
Now we have 9 left and need to reach 43 with the difference of 9. If we consider:
34 + 9 = 43
This works! So we've found our equation.
</think>
<answer> (58 - 24) + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider all the possible basic arithmetic operations and how they might combine the numbers to get 35 using each number only once.
- Multiplying and dividing can help bring down the larger numbers.
- Adding or subtracting larger numbers isn't very helpful since the result will be too large.
- If I take 42 and 32, their difference is 10. If I add 56 and 1 subtract that 10, I get 56 - 10 + 17 = 53, which is close but not 35.
- Alternatively, with the numbers 17, 56, and 32, I can use 32 - 17 = 15, and then 15 + 56 = 71. Now, subtracting 42 gives 71 - 42 = 29, which is still not 35.
- If I consider 42 + 17 = 59. Then to get closer to 35, I try subtracting 32, which gives 59 - 32 = 27, which is far off.
- So, I'll reconsider 42 - 32 = 10, and then see if I can reach 35 from the remaining numbers: 56 and 17. If I add 17 and multiply by 2, I get (17 + 17) * (56 / 56) = 34, so this isn't it.
- A combination that seems promising is 42 - 56 = -14, and -14 + 32 + 17 = 35.
</think>
<answer> (42 - 56) + 32 + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers 52, 15, and 54 exactly once, I need to try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider using subtraction to lower the highest number, 52:
54 - 52 = 2
Then we have 15 to use. We can try adding and subtracting 15:
2 + 15 = 17
17 - 15 = 2
This isn't getting us anywhere close to 30.
Instead, let's try multiplication and division. If we divide 54 by 15:
54 / 15 = 3. 6
And then multiply the result by 52:
3. 6 * 52 = 187. 2
This is too high.
Let's try another combination. What if we use 15 in division with 52:
52 / 15 = 3. 4666...
And then use 54:
54 / 3. 4666... = 15. 4666...
This isn't an integer, so let's try another approach.
Let's use 52 - 15:
52 - 15 = 37
And then divide by 54:
37 / 54 is not an integer either.
Finally, let's consider:
(54 - 15) / 52 = 3. 63...
This isn't 30 either. 
For sure, it seems I missed something. Revisiting the numbers, we must reconsider:
(54 - 52) + 15 = 2 + 15 = 17
And we need to adjust the equation. I remember a simpler way:
54 - (52 / 15) = 54 - 3. 4666... = 50. 5333...
This still doesn't work. Let's simplify:
15 * 2 = 30
So, I need to rethink using the numbers.
After all attempts, I realize:
15 * (54 - 52) = 15 * 2 = 30
</think>
<answer> 15 * (54 - 52) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 78, 29, and 86. We need to create an equation that equals 21 using these numbers exactly once.
Let's start by looking at the possible sums and differences:
- 78 + 29 = 107 (which is too high)
- 78 - 29 = 49 (which is also too high)
- 78 + 86 = 164 (which is even higher)
- 78 - 86 = -8 (which is too low)

Now, let's try combinations with 29:
- 29 + 86 = 115 (too high)
- 29 - 78 = -49 (too low)

Finally, let's try 86 - 29:
- 86 - 29 = 57 (too high)
- 29 - 86 + 78 = 21
This last option works because:
- First, we subtract 29 from 86, which gives us 57.
- Then we add 78 to it, which brings the total to 21.
</think>
<answer> 29 - 86 + 78 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 64, 19, and 25 to get 70. One way to do this is to consider the possibility of subtracting one number from another and then adding the remaining results. 
- 64 - 19 = 45
- Now I have 25 and 45
- 25 + 45 = 70
So, the equation that works is 64 - 19 + 25 = 70.
</think>
<answer> (64 - 19) + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 53, 12, and 22 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 43. Let's try various combinations:
1. 53 - 12 - 22 = 19 (Not 43)
2. 53 - (12 + 22) = 19 (Not 43)
3. (53 + 12) - 22 = 43 (This seems promising)
4. Using (53 + 12) - 22 gives us 43, which is the target number.
So, the equation will be (53 + 12) - 22 = 43.
</think>
<answer> (53 + 12) - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 55, 30, and 14 to make 71.
Let's start by looking at the numbers and trying to add or subtract them:
55 + 30 = 85
71 is closer to 85 than to 14, so let's try to subtract 14:
85 - 14 = 71
This gives us the equation: 55 + 30 - 14 = 71
Since the conditions are met (each number is used only once and all operations are basic), this equation works.
</think>
<answer> (55 + 30) - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 10, 70, and 49 with basic arithmetic operations to get 31. 
First, let's consider if multiplication or division might help reduce the numbers to a more manageable size for the target of 31. 
Multiplying 70 by 49 gives 3430, which is way too high. 
Dividing 70 by 49 gives 1.4286, which also doesn't seem helpful.
Considering addition and subtraction, let's try combinations:
70 + 10 = 80 (too high)
70 - 10 = 60 (too low)
10 + 49 = 59 (too high)
49 - 10 = 39 (too low)
By now, it seems the target operation needs to be an intermediate combination that when simplified hits 31. 
One possible path is: 
(70 - 49) + 10 = 21 + 10 = 31
This matches our goal perfectly.
</think>
<answer> (70 - 49) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 6, 2, and 32 exactly once to create an equation that equals 36. Let's consider the numbers we have:
- 6
- 2
- 32
I notice that 32 is quite large and far from 36. Also, 2 is too small to make up the difference. Since addition and subtraction wouldn't likely produce 36 with these numbers, let's consider multiplication and division.
Multiplying 6 and 2 gives me 12, which is closer to 36 than adding 32 would be. Subtracting 32 from 36 gives me 4, which could be accomplished with 6 - 2. So 6 * 2 - 32 gives me -8, which is not 36.
Considering 6 * 32 / 2 should utilize all numbers. This means we'll get 6 * 16 = 96 and then 96 / 2 = 48, which isn't 36 either.
Looking again at 6 * 2 = 12, let's see what happens if we add 32 to 12: 12 + 32 = 44, which is not 36.
I realize if I try 6 + (32 / 2), I get 6 + 16 = 22, which is still not 36.
The correct way to make 36 would be: 6 * 2 + 32 = 12 + 32 = 44, which does not work either.
The only combination that works is: 32 - 6 - 2 = 30, but I need it to be 36.
Reconsidering, 32 + 6 - 2 does not work.
After reviewing, I realize using 32 + 6 - 2 would be 32 + 6 - 2: 38 - 2 = 36.
</think>
<answer> 32 + 6 - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number, which is 76. The numbers given are 18, 70, and 12. I can start by trying combinations of these numbers using the basic arithmetic operations.
- If I subtract 12 from 70, I get 58, leaving me with a difference of 18 and a target of 76. So, 70 - 12 = 58 and then 76 - 58 = 18.
- Now, 18 is exactly what we have from the numbers, so to reach 76 we need 58, which we got by 70 - 12.
- Therefore, the equation can be: 70 - 12 + 18 = 76
I've used each number exactly once and one operation of subtraction and addition.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 12 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number 49 and the numbers we have: 11, 83, and 45. I notice that 83 - 45 = 38, which is close to 49. If I can make up the difference with 11, it might work.
Now, to get from 38 to 49, I need to add 11. This solution seems plausible because I only need to use one number for each operation in the equation.
Therefore, the equation I'm looking for is (83 - 45) + 11, which equals 49.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 45) + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 83, and 84 that equals 57. We can use basic arithmetic operations. Let's consider each number and how we might manipulate them to get 57.
First, let's see if we can use operations to reduce one of the numbers to 57 or create 57 from their sum or difference.
84 - 83 = 1
This is not 57.
Let's try another combination:
83 - 57 = 26
Again, this doesn't work.
Now let's consider:
57 + 83 = 140
This is too high.
Now let's try:
57 * (84 - 83) = 57 * 1 = 57
We successfully get 57 by multiplying 57 by 1 (which comes from the operation 84 - 83).
</think>
<answer> 57 * (84 - 83) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers and the target: 85, 73, 89, and 41, with the goal of reaching 60.
- One approach is to subtract smaller numbers from larger ones. Let's try 89 - 41 = 48. This is close to our target.
- Now we need to get from 48 to 60. We can achieve this by adding 12. 
- Looking at our remaining numbers (85 and 73), 85 - 73 = 12.
- Therefore, we can construct the equation as: 89 - 41 + (85 - 73) = 60.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 41 + 85 - 73 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 14, 1, 80, and 51 that can be used with basic arithmetic operations to equal 16. 
I notice that 51 is quite large and 80 is a multiple of 8, so I'll start with those to see what I can do.
If I subtract 51 from 80, I get:
80 - 51 = 29
Now I have 14 and 1 left, and I need to combine 29 with 14 and 1 to reach 16.
29 + 14 = 43, which is too much.
If I use subtraction, I need to get closer to 16. Maybe if I use 14 - 29 that's not possible.
Since addition and subtraction weren't successful, let's try multiplication and division.
Dividing 80 by 51 gives approximately 1.56, which is close but not exactly 16.
Now considering the numbers 14 and 1, I can see that 14 - 80 / 51 is not straightforward either.
Considering the equation structure I have a better chance with subtraction, thus:
(80 - 51) - (14 - 1) = 29 - 13 = 16
So, the equation is (80 - 51) - (14 - 1) = 16
</think>
<answer> (80 - 51) - (14 - 1) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 38, 5, and 9 exactly once to get 34. Let's try combining them in various ways using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One possible way is to see if we can reach 34 by adding or subtracting some numbers and then adjusting with multiplication or division.
Let's start with the middle number, 5, and see if we can make use of the other numbers around it.
(38 - 9) + 5 = 29 + 5 = 34.
So this seems to work. We can use 38 - 9 to get 29, and then add 5 to get 34.
</think>
<answer> (38 - 9) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 59, 14, and 10. We need to use each exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 83.
- Starting with 59 and 14: 59 + 14 = 73, which is close but still short of 83.
- Now, if I add 10 to 73: 73 + 10 = 83, which is exactly what we need.
So, the equation will be: 59 + 14 + 10 = 83.
</think>
<answer> (59 + 14) + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 82, 49, and 53 that will give me 86 using the basic arithmetic operations. 
Considering the gap between the largest number 82 and the target 86 is 4, while the difference between 82 and the smallest number 49 is 33, it seems adding or subtracting these might not yield 86.
Now, looking at 49 and 53, subtracting 53 from 49 gives -4, which isn't helpful as a positive change.
Considering multiplication or division, multiplying or dividing by 82 or 49 or 53 doesn't seem to bring us closer to 86.
Multiplying 49 by 1 (which can be derived from 53 - 49) gives 49, then adding 37 isn't possible with the available numbers.
But if I take 53 and subtract 49, it gives 4. Now I need 82 more to reach 86. This aligns with 82 as 82 = 53 + 29. Given no other numbers available, 29 can be created using 49 - 53 + 53 = 29. 
Thus, (53 - 49) + 53 = 4, and 82 - 4 = 78, then adding that 78 to get to 86 - 4 = 86. But I need to simplify and check the steps to confirm.
So the correct way is just directly: 53 + 33 = 86 is not possible with basic operations here. Hence, checking other combinations:
53 + 49/1 = 82.5 isn't an integer solution.
Another possibility is: 53 + (82 - 49) = 86. Corrected calculation shows: 
82 - 49 = 33, 53 + 33 = 86.
So, finally we should affix: (53 + (82 - 49)) = 86. </think>
<answer> (53 + (82 - 49)) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 32, 6, and 63 to make 89. Let's first add 32 and 63:
32 + 63 = 95
This is close, but a bit too high. Now, let's subtract 6:
95 - 6 = 89
This gives us the desired result of 89. Therefore, the equation is:
(32 + 63) - 6 = 89
</think>
<answer> (32 + 63) - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers and the target number, 30. The numbers provided are 12, 47, 34, and 31. One way to approach this could be to look for combinations of operations that might result in 30.
I notice that 47 - 34 = 13 and 12 + 31 = 43, but this doesn't help since 13 and 43 are too far from 30.
Next, let's consider other operations. If we look at 47 - 34, we can use 12 and 31 in a new way. If we take 31 - 12, we get 19. If we then subtract this from 47 - 34, we get:
(47 - 34) - (31 - 12) = 13 - 19 = -6
That's not right either. I should try a different approach with the same numbers.
Let's try a different combination: 47 - 31 = 16, and 34 - 12 = 22. Now if we subtract these, we get:
(47 - 31) - (34 - 12) = 16 - 22 = -6
That doesn't work either. Let's try another approach.
How about using: 31 + 12 = 43 and 47 - 34 = 13. If we subtract the smaller from the larger, we get:
(47 - 34) - (31 + 12) = 13 - 43 = -30
This is close, but in the wrong direction. Let's flip it:
(31 + 12) - (47 - 34) = 43 - 13 = 30
This gives us the correct result of 30 and uses each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (31 + 12) - (47 - 34) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find a combination of the given numbers 11, 70, 30, and 97 using basic arithmetic operations that results in 46. I'll try different combinations:
First, let's consider adding and subtracting these numbers:
11 + 70 - 30 - 97 = -46
This is not what we want.
Next, let's try multiplication and addition:
11 * 30 + 70 - 97 = 330 + 70 - 97 = 330 + 70 - 97 = 312 - 97 = 215
This is also not 46.
Now let's try another arrangement:
(70 - 30) + 11 + 97 = 40 + 11 + 97 = 51 + 97 = 148
No luck there either.
I will now try a different approach:
(97 - 30) - (70 - 11) = 67 - 59 = 8
This is close, but not what we want.
Finally, let's try this:
11 + 30 - 70 + 97 = 41 + 27 = 68
It's still too high.
Now one last attempt:
97 - 70 + 30 - 11 = 27 + 29 = 56
And this oversteps.
There was no other combination that worked for me. However, upon re-examination, it appears I made an oversight. The correct combination is likely:
(97 - 70) + (30 - 11) = 27 + 19 = 46
Thus, the equation that equals 46 using the numbers 11, 70, 30, and 97, is:
(97 - 70) + (30 - 11) = 46
</think>
<answer>(97 - 70) + (30 - 11)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers given: 11, 70, 30, and 97. We need to form an equation using these numbers only once each to equal 46.
- Adding and subtracting the numbers doesn't seem to get us close to 46.
- Multiplying and dividing the numbers doesn't seem straightforward either.
- Let's try combining them in different ways:
  - 97 - 70 = 27, adding 11 gets us 38, which is still too high.
  - 97 - 30 = 67, subtracting 70 gets us -8, which is wrong.
  - 70 - 30 = 40, then we need 6 more to reach 46, but we only have 11 left and 11 - 6 = 5, which isn't 6.
  - 97 + 30 = 127, subtracting 70 gets us 57, which is too high.
  - Adding 11 to 70 gives 81, then subtracting 30 gets us 51, and finally, subtracting 97 would miss our target. We're not getting close to 46.
  - Looking at 97 - 30 - 11 = 56, which is very far from 46. 
  - 97 - 70 = 27, and then 27 - 30 = -3, adding 11 won't help since it's already too low.
  - 97 - 30 = 67, 70 + 11 = 81, then dividing 81 by 3 (as 97/7 = 14. 57 but we can't use 7) is not feasible.
  - If we consider the combination 70 + 11 = 81, 97 - 81 = 16, and 16 - 30 gets us too much.
  - Finally it seems a straight forward way to reach 46 by subtracting numbers: 97 - 30 - 11 = 56, subtract 10 (a number that isn't provided) and 8 would be needed which can only be achieved by tricks not allowed.
  - Then another simpler path 97 - 70 = 27, and adding 19 to 27 would give 46. Now 19 can be formed by 30 - 11.
Therefore, we use: 97 - 70 + (30 - 11) = 46.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 70 + (30 - 11) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to explore different combinations of the numbers 15, 51, and 73 using basic arithmetic operations to reach 37.
- If I add 15 and 51, I get 66, which is too high.
- If I subtract 15 from 51, I get 36, which is close to 37.
- If I add 36 to 73, I exceed 37.
- If I subtract 73 from 15, it's impossible since 15 is less than 73.
Considering the single-digit sums and the operations available, subtracting 73 from 36 does not work either.
- Subtracting 51 from 15 gives a negative number, which doesn't fit.
- Adding 51 and 15 gives 66, which again is too high.
From the above exploration, the only feasible addition that reaches close to 37 is 51 + 15 = 66. To reduce from 66 to 37, I subtract 29, but 73 - 51 = 22, which is closer but not 29.
I overlooked a possible combination. Let's try 73 - 51 = 22. Now, if I add 15 to 22, this gives 37. This combination works.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 51 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 8, 20, and 10. We need to find a combination of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 38.
One way to approach this is to think about which number might be directly useful or needs to be adjusted to get closer to 38. Notice that 20 + 10 = 30, which is close to 38. If we add another number to this result, we need 8 to make it 38. Therefore, the equation would be 20 + 10 + 8 = 38.
This makes sense because adding 8 to 30 gives us 38.
</think>
<answer> (20 + 10) + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 38, 17, and 26 exactly once to get 47. Let's start by checking if the sum or difference of any two of these numbers is close to 47. 
- 38 + 17 = 55 (too high)
- 38 + 26 = 64 (too high)
- 17 + 26 = 43 (close but not enough)
- 38 - 17 = 21 (too low)
- 38 - 26 = 12 (too low)
- 17 - 26 = -9 (too low)
Next, I'll consider multiplication and division, but these operations typically result in higher or lower numbers rather than 47 by using only these three numbers once each.
- 38 * 17 / 26 = 241.00 (very high)
- 38 / 17 * 26 = 58.11 (not 47)
- 17 * 26 / 38 = 12.05 (not 47)
None of the operations work independently or in combination. But let's check another possibility: 
- Notice that 38 - 17 = 21
- We can use 26 + (38 - 17) = 26 + 21 = 47
So, the equation is: 26 + (38 - 17) = 47.
</think>
<answer> 26 + (38 - 17) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 38, 17, and 26 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 47.
First, let's consider if we can combine any of these numbers to get close to 47.
- 38 + 17 = 55 (too high)
- 38 + 26 = 64 (too high)
- 17 + 26 = 43 (still far from 47)
- 38 - 17 = 21 (still short, but moving in the right direction)
Now, consider combining 21 with the remaining number:
- 21 + 26 = 47 (this works)
So, the numbers 38, 17, and 26 can be combined with the operations + and + to make 47. </think>
<answer> (38 + 26) - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 8, 48, 23, and 5 exactly once to get 38. Let's try to use some arithmetic operations to reach this number.
- First, I notice that 48 is quite large and 5 is quite small, so subtraction or division involving these could be useful.
- If I subtract 23 from 48, I get 25. Now I need 13 more to reach 38.
- With the remaining numbers 8 and 5, 5 + 8 = 13.
- So, 48 - 23 + 5 + 8 = 38.
</think>
<answer> (48 - 23) + 5 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 2, 11, and 24 exactly once to get 70. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Multiplying two of the numbers might help reach our target, but since 11 * 24 equals 264 which is too large, that's not a good start.
- Adding or subtracting the numbers directly gives values far from 70.
- The only feasible operation left is division. Let's see if dividing 24 by 2 or 11 by 2 can lead us to 70.
- Dividing 24 by 2 equals 12. Now I need 70 - 12 = 58 to be made from 11 and 2.
- Dividing 11 by 2 is 5.5, which isn't an integer and thus not helping us directly.
- Dividing 11 by 2 will give us 5.5, and then multiplying it by 2 would give us 11, but I need 12, which can be formed by adding 2 and 10 and since 10 is not in the set, this doesn't work.
So, I must reconsider 11 - (24 / 2) = 11 - 12 = -1. Adding 71 to -1 will not yield 70.
Finally, I consider 24 / 2 + 11 * 2 = 12 + 22 = 34. Therefore, using these numbers and operations once, we still need 36 more to reach 70. I realize the only way to get 36 from the remaining numbers is if I modify the approach.
Considering (24 - 11) * 2 = 13 * 2 = 26. Adding another possible configuration: (2 * 11) - 24 = 22 - 24 = -2. Then 70 - (-2) = 72, which overshoots again.
I incorrectly think 24 / (11 - 2) = 24 / 9. I realize 24 should be 2*(11-2), 24/3 = 8.  Then 2*(11-2)+8=2*9+8=18+8=26. And 70-26=44, still missed. 
Finally, I realize 24-(11-2*2) = 24 - (11 - 4) = 24 - 7 = 17. And 70-17 = 53, still missed. 
I realize if I first add 11+2=13, then 24-13 = 11. Adding another 11 gives a total of 22. 70-22 = 48, yet missed.
Then, I realize using 24 - 2 = 22 and 2 * 11 = 22 gets 44 which is still missed. 
Realizing the right configuration is: 2 * 24 - (11 + 2) = 48 - 13 = 35. And 70-35 = 35, still missed. 
Thinking through combinations now, I return to: (24 - (2 * 11)) + 2 = 24 - 22 + 2 = 4. For 70 - 4 = 66, still missed.
I finally get the right configuration: 24 - (11 + 2 * 2) = 24 - (11 + 4) = 24 - 15 = 9. 70 - 9 = 61, still missed.
Concluding: 11 + 24 - (2 * 2) = 11 + 24 - 4 = 35. 70 - 35 = 35, still missed.
Reconsidering, I get 24 * (2 - 11/2) = 24 * (0.5) = 12. 70 - (24 * (0.5)) = 70 - 12 = 58, still missed.
Final realization: For the correct configuration 2 * (11 + 24) - 0 = 2 * (35) - 0 = 70.
</think>
<answer> 2 * (11 + 24) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to consider how I can manipulate the numbers 35, 71, 36, and 48 to get 24. One approach is to look for combinations that might involve multiplication or subtraction to reach a useful intermediate value.
- Multiplying 48 and 36 would give 1728, which is way too big.
- Dividing 71 by 35 is approximately 2.03, which is not very useful.
Trying combinations like (35-36) + 48 = 1, (35-36) + 71 = 56, or similar, doesn't get close to 24.
Another combination: 71 - 35 = 36, and then 36 - 36 leaves us with 0. Clearly, this isn't 24 either.
I notice that 71 - 35 = 36. Then looking at 48, I realize that 48 - 36 = 12, so we have 36 + 12.
But we're still far from 24. Now let's try another combination: 71 - 35 = 36, and then 36 - 36 equals 0, so we should look for a way to use 48 more effectively.
The key realization is that 71 - 35 = 36, and 36 - 36 = 0, and now we have to get to 24. One possible way to use 48 is 48 - 36 = 12, and then 71 - 12 is 59, which is close, but too high.
However, 71 - 48 = 23, and then 36 - 35 is 1, and 23 + 1 gives us 24. Thus, the equation is 71 - 48 + (36 - 35) = 24.
</think>
<answer> 71 - 48 + (36 - 35) </answer>

==============
<think> To get 97 using the numbers 45, 46, and 6 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I'll start by considering which numbers can be combined to get close to 97.
First, let's try adding 46 and 6. 
46 + 6 = 52
Now we need 45 more to reach 97.
52 + 45 = 97
So in equation form, we have:
46 + 6 + 45 = 97
</think>
<answer> (46 + 6 + 45) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 36, 6, and 95 exactly once to get 65. Let's start by considering the possible operations.
95 - 36 = 59
This is close to 65 but not quite there. Now, if we use 6:
59 + 6 = 65
This gives us the target number 65 using all the numbers exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 36) + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 25, 30, and 98 once each to get the result 43. 
First, let's consider the numbers given. 98 is the largest and seems like it might be involved in the final calculation. If I subtract 98 from 43, I get -55, which doesn't help much.
Next, let's think about combining 25 and 30. Their sum is 55. However, we can't just add or subtract them to get 43.
Now, let's consider multiplying or dividing the numbers. If I divide 98 by 25, I get 3.92. This is closer to 43 but not quite there.
When I consider adding 30 and 25, I get 55, and then subtracting 98 would indeed get me close to 43, but it goes in the wrong direction. 
Since none of these direct operations seem to fit, let's reconsider subtracting 30 and 25 from 98. 
Subtracting 30 from 98 gives 68, and then subtracting another 25 from 68 gives 43.
This meets our criteria of using each number only once and results in 43.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 30 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 25, 30, and 98 that equals 43. 
Let's start with simple operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 25 + 30 = 55 (too high)
- Subtracting and adding: 98 - 25 = 73 (too high)
- Adding and dividing: 25 + 30 / 98 (30 / 98 is less than 1) (too low)
- Subtracting and dividing: 98 - 25 - 30 = 43 (this seems promising)
- Multiplying: The products are 25 * 30 = 750 (way too high)
I see that using subtraction and division gives us the right result: 98 - 25 - 30 = 43.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 25 - 30)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 14, 75, and 93. We need to use each exactly once to make 32.
One way to approach this is to start with subtraction or addition to see if we can simplify our numbers towards 32.
If we subtract 93 from 75, we get -18. That's not going to help us reach 32.
Next, let's try another combination: 93 - 75 = 18. Now we need 32 - 18 = 14 to reach the target.
75 - 18 = 57, but we need to get 14. Now, let's try 93 - 75 - 14: 93 - 75 = 18, 18 - 14 = 4, which is not 32.
The combination 75 - 93 + 14 seems promising: 75 - 93 = -18, and then -18 + 14 = -4. We're still not at 32.
Finally, let's test 93 - 75 + 14, which gives: 93 - 75 = 18, and then 18 + 14 = 32.
So the equation that works is 93 - 75 + 14 = 32.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 75 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 14, 75, and 93. We need to create an equation that equals 32 using these numbers exactly once. 
- If we add 14 and 93, we get 107, which is too high.
- If we subtract 14 from 93, we get 79, which is also too high.
- If we subtract 75 from 93, we get 18, which is still not 32.
- Now, let's try 75 - 14. This gives us 61, which is too high as well.
- This means let's multiply 14 and 93 which gives us 128. However, that's not 32.
- Perhaps, we should try multiplication with 75. Multiplying 75 by 14 gives us 1050, which is far from 32.
- When we think about dividing the numbers, let's try 93 divided by 14. This gives us approximately 6. 6428, which is not 32.
- If we divide 75 by 14, we get around 5. 3571, which is not 32.
- Now, let's consider the combination: 75 - 14 - 93. This gives us -32, so we need to adjust.
- We see that we need to get 32, not -32. Let's re-evaluate:
- 75 - 14 - 93 does not give 32.
- Let's try a combination of multiplication and subtraction:
- 75 / 14 + 14 / 93, this is not 32. Let's try it another way around.
- Looking at 75 - (14 * (93 / 14)). This gives us 75 - (14 * 6. 6429) ≈ 75 - 93, which is a large negative number.
- Backtracking slightly:
- 93 / 14 - 75 should not be correct. Let's try another possibility.
- 93 - (75 / 14) does not work.
- 75 - 14 * 93 / 14 won't work.
- Let's try a simple equation:
- 93 / 14 - 75 = this is not 32.
- We need to re-evaluate thoroughly:
- 93 - 14 - 75 = -32 which is close to negative 32 but we need positive 32.
- Correct attempt should be:
- 14 + (75 - 93) = 14 - 18 = -4, but this needs to be correct.
- We try the right sequence:
- 93 - 75 + 14 = 32.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 75 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider all the possible combinations using the basic arithmetic operations with the numbers 19, 99, and 42 only once.
- 99 + 19 - 42 = 76
- 99 - 19 + 42 = 122 (which is not 76)
- 99 * 19 / 42 is not a whole number and doesn't equal 76
- 99 / 19 + 42 is not a whole number and doesn't equal 76
- 19 + 99 + 42 is 160 (which is not 76)
From the combinations above, the only equation that equals 76 is 99 + 19 - 42.
</think>
<answer> 99 + 19 - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 86, 22, and 6 exactly once to get 70. One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of subtraction to make the numbers more manageable.
- If I subtract 6 from 86, I get 80.
- Now I need to get from 80 to 70 using the remaining number, 22.
- Subtracting 22 from 80 gives me 58, which is not 70.
- Adding 22 to 80 gives me 102, which is too large.
- Instead, let's try subtracting 22 from 86, which gives me 64.
- Now I need to get from 64 to 70 using 6.
- Subtracting 6 from 64 gives me 58, which is not 70.
- Adding 6 to 64 gives me 70, which is what we need.
So the equation can be 86 - 22 + 6 = 70.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 22) + 6 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 60, 18, 7, and 6 exactly once to get 43.
Starting with the larger number 60, subtracting 18 gives us 42.
From 42, we need to reduce by 7 to get close to 43.
Subtracting 7 from 42 leaves us with 35.
Now, 35 - 6 = 29, which is not 43, so it seems we need to reverse the previous steps.
Let's try a different approach:
If we take 60 - 18 = 42, and then 42 + 7 = 49, which is too high.
Now, let's think about 60 + 18 = 78, which is way too high.
We need to think about using multiplication or division to adjust the value.
18 * 6 = 108, which is not practical given the numbers left.
Considering 60 - (18 / 6) = 60 - 3 = 57, which is too much.
Let's reconsider the combination: 60 - 18 + 7 + 6, but in that order.
60 - 18 = 42, then 42 + 7 = 49, then 49 + 6 = 55, which is still not 43.
Now, let's try: (60 - 18) + 7 + 6.
This simplifies to 42 + 7 + 6, which equals 55.
Inverting the process, we see that the correct arrangement might be: (60 - 18) + 7 - 6.
This gives us: 42 + 7 - 6 = 43.
</think>

<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 63, 46, and 70 exactly once that equals 39. One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's start with subtraction and addition:
63 - 46 = 17
17 + 70 = 87
That doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
63 - 70 = -7
46 + (-7) = 39
This seems promising. We can use subtraction and addition to achieve our goal.
</think>
<answer> 63 - 70 + 46 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers available: 31, 87, and 53. We need to use each number exactly once to reach the result of 65 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the possible combinations of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
1. Let's try to see if we can get close to 65 using addition and subtraction.
   - 87 + 53 = 140 (too high)
   - 87 + 31 = 118 (still too high)
   - 53 + 31 = 84 (still too high)
   - Now let's try 87 - 53 = 34. This seems like a reasonable interim result.
   - We need 31 more to reach 65. So 34 + 31 = 65. This works!
Therefore, the equation is 87 - 53 + 31 = 65.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 53 + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 31, 87, and 53 that, when combined using arithmetic operations, equals 65.
I'll start by looking at the operation that can bring us closer to 65. Adding or subtracting the numbers doesn't seem to work directly, so I'll try multiplication and division.
87 * 53 = 4653 (which is too large)
53 * 31 = 1643 (also too large)
4653 / 53 = 87.6 (not 65)
1643 / 53 = 31. (not 65)
Considering the operations, I try another approach by combining the numbers:
53 + 31 = 84
Now I need 10 more to reach 65, which isn't possible with these numbers.
Let me try the subtraction way:
87 - 53 = 34
Then, 65 - 34 = 31. This works if we use 31 once. 
Thus, 87 - 53 + 31 = 65.
</think>
<answer> (87 - 53) + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers given: 11, 61, 91, and 12. I need to use these numbers to get to 53 using basic arithmetic operations.
I notice that 61 - 91 = -30, which is not helpful.
Let's try 91 - 61 = 30, which is also not good.
Now, I think about using 11 and 12: 11 * 4 + 12 = 56.
That's close to 53, but not quite there.
Another way is to think: 11 + 42 = 53, and 42 is 12 + 30.
We already know 91 - 61 = 30.
So, let's try: 11 + (12 + (91 - 61)) = 11 + (12 + 30) = 11 + 42 = 53.
This gives us the equation: 11 + (12 + (91 - 61)).
</think>
<answer> (11 + (12 + (91 - 61))) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 69, 38, and 41 exactly once to get an answer of 10 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try combining them in different ways:
- First, 69 - 38 = 31
- Then, we need to subtract something from 31 to get 10
- 31 - 41 = -11, not 10
- Now, let's try other combinations like 69 - 41 = 28 or 38 - 28 = 10
- However, 28 is not made by combining 38 and 41 in any way we've tried.
- Next, let's try 69 - 38 = 31, and then 31 - 41 = -11
- Now, let's see if we can use any other operations, for example, 69 + 38 - 41 = 66 - 41 = 25
- No combinations using addition, subtraction, or a mix seem to work so far.
- Let's try another approach: 69 + 38 - 41 = 107 - 41 = 66
- We need to subtract something to reach 10, but the remaining subtraction options do not work.
- Finally, let's try: 69 - (38 + 41) = 69 - 79 = -10
- This is the closest we've gotten but not 10.
- We missed an option: 41 + 38 - 69 = 80 - 69 = 11
- We're close, let's try: 38 - (69 - 41) = 38 - 28 = 10
This combination works because it uses all numbers exactly once and gives us the result of 10.
</think>
<answer> 38 - (69 - 41) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 84, 25, and 22 exactly once to get 81. Let's try different combinations of operations.
- First, let's consider subtraction:
  84 - 25 = 59
  Now we need 22 less to make 81.
  59 - 22 = 37 (not 81)
- Next, let's try multiplication and subtraction:
  84 * 25 = 2100 (way too high)
  2100 - 22 = 2078 (too high)
- Now, let's try a combination of subtraction and addition:
  (84 - 25) + 22 = 59 + 22 = 81
This seems to work. The equation is (84 - 25) + 22 = 81.
</think>
<answer> (84 - 25) + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 83, 91, and 4 exactly once to make the expression equal to 32. Let's try different combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's consider adding and subtracting these numbers:
- 91 + 83 - 4 = 170 - 4 = 166 (too high)
- 91 + 4 - 83 = 95 - 83 = 12 (too low)
Now, let's try multiplication and division:
- 91 * 4 - 83 = 364 - 83 = 281 (too high)
- 83 * 4 - 91 = 332 - 91 = 241 (too high)
- 4 * 83 - 91 = 332 - 91 = 241 (too high)
- 4 * 91 - 83 = 364 - 83 = 281 (too high)
None of these give us 32. Let's try a combination of operations:
- (91 - 83) * 4 = 8 * 4 = 32 (This matches our target)
So, the equation that works is (91 - 83) * 4.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 83) * 4 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 41, 30, and 24 exactly once to make an equation that equals 13. 
Let's try combining operations:
- First, 41 - 30 = 11. 
- Then subtract 24 from 11: 11 - 24 = -13. 
This isn't 13, and we need a positive 13.
- Instead, let's try 41 - 24 - 30: 
  41 - 24 = 17, 
  then 17 - 30 = -13. 
  Still not 13.
- Now let's try another combination: 41 - (30 - 24): 
  30 - 24 = 6, 
  then 41 - 6 = 35. 
  This is too large.
- Let's try 30 + 24 - 41: 
  30 + 24 = 54, 
  54 - 41 = 13.
This works as 30 + 24 - 41 equals 13.
</think>
<answer> 30 + 24 - 41 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 76, 48, and 97 that equals 27. We can use basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number can only be used once.
Let's start by considering the numbers and operations:
1. 97 - 48 = 49
2. 76 - 48 = 28
3. 97 - 76 = 21
None of the above combinations give us 27. Let's try another combination:
Considering another possible combination:
1. 97 - 48 = 49 (from above)
2. 49 - 22 (which we need to find using 76 and 97)
3. 76 - 97 = -21 (negative result, not helpful)
4. 97 - 76 = 21 (difference)
Upon reconsideration, 76 + 48 = 124 which is too large, and 76 - 48 = 28 which is also not what we need.
Let's try a different approach:
Considering operations on 48 and 97 (since these are close):
48 + 97 = 145 (way larger)
Considering 97 - 48 = 49 (removing this option)
Let’s try different combinations with operations:
97 - (76 - 48) = 97 - 28 = 69
(97 + 48) - 76 = 145 - 76 = 69
None of the above are correct. Let’s try 97 - 76 + 48 = 3 + 48 = 51
Now, considering different operations with 48 and 76:
(97 + 48) - 76 = 145 - 76 = 69 (not 27)
97 - 48 + 76 = 49 + 76 = 125 (too large)
Considering the smallest possible operations:
97 - 48 = 49, now we need to use 76 in such a way that we achieve 27 
76 - (97 - 48) = 76 - 49 = 27
So we got it.
</think>
<answer> 76 - (97 - 48) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 54, 66, and 59 exactly once to get 61. Let's try different combinations of operations:
1. 66 + 54 - 59 = 120 - 59 = 61. This works!
So, the equation is 66 + 54 - 59 = 61.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 54 - 59 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 61 using the numbers 54, 66, and 59 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I need to consider all possible operations and combinations.
- First, let's see if we can get close to 61 by addition or subtraction:
  - 66 + 59 = 125 (too high)
  - 66 + 54 = 120 (too high)
  - 66 - 54 = 12 (too low)
  - 59 - 54 = 5 (too low)
- Now, let's try multiplication and division:
  - 66 * 59 = 3894 (way too high)
  - 66 / 54 = 1.2222... (not an integer and doesn't work)
  - 59 * 54 = 3226 (way too high)
  - 54 * 59 = 3186 (way too high)
As seen, no combination of the given numbers using these operations gives us 61. However, let's consider if we can form 61 by using combinations and operations previously overlooked:
  - Using 66 - (59 - 54) = 66 - 5 = 61
- 59 - 54 = 5
- 66 - 5 = 61
This suggests the equation: 66 - (59 - 54) = 61.
</think>
<answer> 66 - (59 - 54) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 25, 10, 51, and 17 exactly once to get 53. Let's start by trying different combinations of operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 25 + 10 = 35, 35 + 17 = 52, but 52 + 1 == 53 or 52 - 2 etc. doesn't work with our numbers.
- Multiplying and dividing: 51 * 1 / 10 gives values far away from 53.
Now let's try 51 + 10 - 25, which equals 36, not 53.
Next, try 51 - 25 + 10 = 36, which is not 53.
Another combination is 51 + 10 - 17, which results in 44, not 53.
Finally, let's try 51 + 10 - 25 - 17 = 51 + 10 - 42 = 11 + 10 - 25 = 21 - 25 = -4, which is still not right.
Now, let's try 51 + (10 - 25) + 17 = 51 + (-15) + 17 = 51 - 15 + 17 = 36 + 17 = 53. This matches our target.
</think>
<answer> 51 + (10 - 25) + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that results in 66 using the numbers 54, 95, and 83 exactly once, with each number used only once. 
First, let's consider the operations we have: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
If we look at the numbers, 95 and 83 are larger and could be useful for getting closer to 66 when combined. Let's try some combinations.
95 - 83 = 12
This gives us a result of 12. Now we need another number to make 66, and we have 54 left.
12 + 54 = 66
So, we get 66.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 83) + 54 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 47, 51, and 5 to make an equation equal to 20. We can use basic arithmetic operations to achieve this. Let's try different combinations.
One approach is to see if we can use subtraction and addition. If we look at the numbers, subtracting 51 from 47 gives us -8, which is too far from 20. Now let's consider using 51 - 47 = 4. Then we can try to add 5 to this result. 4 + 5 = 9, which is still not 20.
Next, let's try 51 - 47 = 4, and see if we can use 5 in any way. We know that 4 * 5 = 20, which is exactly what we need. Therefore, the equation can be (51 - 47) * 5 = 20.
</think>
<answer> (51 - 47) * 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 77, 6, and 38 in such a way that they equal 33. I'll start by looking at the possible operations between the numbers.
- 77 - 6 = 71 (which is too high)
- 77 - 38 = 39 (which is also too high)
- 77 + 6 = 83 (which is too high)
- 77 + 38 = 115 (which is too high)
Now, I will consider operations between 6 and 38.
- 6 + 38 = 44 (which is too high)
Let's consider multiplication and division between the given numbers.
- 6 * 38 = 228 (which is too high)
- 38 / 6 = 6.333 (not an integer, which we can't use for our target)
The operations so far haven't yielded a result of 33. 
Since basic arithmetic operations with the numbers as they are don't seem to help, let's consider if there is another way we can interpret the numbers.
Considering 38 as a complement to 6 and 77:
- 77 - (38 + 6) = 77 - 44 = 33
This gives us the result we are looking for.
</think>
<answer> 77 - (38 + 6) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 75, 20, 16, and 50 exactly once to make 21. 
Let's consider the possible operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
First, I notice that 75 and 50 are large numbers so they're less likely to be the starting point for reaching 21. 
Looking at 20 and 16, I see that 20 - 16 = 4, which is closer to 21. 
If I subtract 4 from 20, I need to make up the difference of 17 using the remaining numbers. 
20 - 4 = 16, and 16 is one of the numbers we have left. 
If we subtract 16, we get 0, but we need 17. 
So let's try adding instead of subtracting, i.e., 20 + 16.
But 20 + 16 = 36, which is much larger than our target of 21. 
Let's try 75 - 20 = 55.
Still, it's too large. 
Considering the operations again, let's try 75 - 20 + 16: 
75 - 20 = 55, 
55 + 16 = 71, which is still too large. 
Now let's try 75 - (20 + 16): 
75 - 20 = 55, 
55 - 16 = 39, still too large.
75 - 20 + 16 - 50 = 21
55 + 16 - 50 = 21
Since we need 21, we can simplify it as: 75 - 20 + 16 - 50 = 21.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 20 + 16 - 50 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find an equation using the numbers 25, 76, 72, and 38 that equals 17. Let's consider the possible combinations:
1. 76 - 72 = 4
2. 76 - 38 = 38 (too high)
3. 76 - 25 = 51
4. 72 - 25 = 47
5. 72 - 38 = 34
6. 38 - 25 = 13
None of these single operations give us 17. Now, let's consider some combinations of these operations:
- (76 - 72) + 25 = 4 + 25 = 29
- (76 - 72) + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42
- (76 - 25) + 38 = 51 + 38 = 89
- (76 - 25) + 72 = 51 + 72 = 123
- (76 - 38) + 25 = 38 + 25 = 63
- (76 - 38) + 72 = 38 + 72 = 110
We're still not reaching 17. Now let's consider:
- (72 - 38) - 25 = 34 - 25 = 9
- (72 - 38) - 76 = 34 - 76 = -42
- 25 - (72 - 38) = 25 - 34 = -9
Nothing is working yet. Let's try a different approach:
- (76 - 72) * 38 = 4 * 38 = 152
- (76 - 38) * 25 = 38 * 25 = 950
I'm still not getting 17. How about:
- 76 / (72 - 25) = 76 / 47 (which is not a whole number)
Let's try a combination of two operations:
- (76 - 72) + (38 - 25) = 4 + 13 = 17
That seems to work! </think>
<answer> (76 - 72) + (38 - 25) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 25, 76, 72, and 38 exactly once to get 17. Let's try different combinations of operations.
First, let's consider addition and subtraction:
- 76 + 25 = 101 (too high)
- 76 + 38 = 114 (too high)
- 76 + 72 = 148 (too high)
- 76 + 25 - 72 = 19 (too high)
- 76 + 25 - 38 = 63 (too high)
Next, let's try multiplication and division:
- 72 * 25 = 1800 (too high)
- 72 * 38 = 2736 (too high)
- 76 * 38 = 2928 (too high)
- 76 * 25 = 1900 (too high)
- 72 / 25 = 2.88 (too low)
- 76 / 25 = 3.04 (too low)
Next, let's try a combination of addition, subtraction, and division:
- (76 - 72) * 25 / 38 = 4 * 25 / 38 = 100 / 38 = 2.63 (too low)
Next, let's try another possible combination:
- 76 - 72 - 38 + 25 = -28 + 25 = -3 (too low)
Now, let's check another possible combination:
- 76 - 72 + 38 - 25 = 4 + 38 - 25 = 42 - 25 = 17
So, the equation that equals 17 is 76 - 72 + 38 - 25 = 17.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 72 + 38 - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 45, 30, and 5 to equal 70. Let's consider different combinations of arithmetic operations:
1. Adding or subtracting 45, 30, and 5: 45 + 30 + 5 = 80 (not 70)
2. Multiplying or dividing 45, 30, and 5: 45 * 30 / 5 = 270 (too high), 45 / 30 * 5 = 7.5 (not 70)
3. Combining different operations: (45 - 30) + 5 = 10 (not 70), 45 + (30 + 5) = 80 (not 70)
4. Considering mixed operations: 45 * 5 / 30 = 7.5 (not 70), (45 + 5) / 30 = 1.5 (not 70)
It appears none of these combinations work exactly. Let's try another combination:
(45 / 5) + 30 = 9 + 30 = 39 (not 70)
45 + (30 / 5) = 45 + 6 = 51 (not 70)
None of the above seem to work either. If we take (30 - 5) + 45:
(30 - 5) + 45 = 25 + 45 = 70
This does equal 70, so (30 - 5) + 45 satisfies the condition.
</think>
<answer> (30 - 5) + 45 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 91 using the numbers 54, 93, and 52 exactly once, I need to consider the arithmetic operations available.
First, let's look at the numbers:
- 93 is the largest, so it could help us reach the target quickly.
- 54 and 52 are smaller, and division might be useful to fit them into our target.
Let's try combining the numbers with different arithmetic operations:
- 93 - 54 = 39 (Not close to 91)
- 93 - 52 = 41 (Still not close enough)
- 93 + 54 = 147 (Too high)
- 93 + 52 = 145 (Also too high)
- Let's try multiplication:
  - 93 * 52 = 4836 (Way too high)
- Let's try division:
  - 93 / 54 gives us a decimal (2.67), which won't help.
  - 52 / 54 also gives us a decimal (0.963), no use.
Considering these attempts, let's look at combinations of subtraction and addition:
- 93 - 54 + 52 = 91
This combination adds up to 91 exactly.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 54) + 52 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 54, 93, and 52 exactly once to get 91. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- First, let's consider if subtraction or addition between numbers might lead us to 91.
- If we try 93 - 54, we get 39, which is not 91.
- Trying 93 - 52 = 41, still not 91.
- Next, let's try 93 - 54 - 52, which gives us -13, which is not 91.
- Now let's try 93 - 54 + 52: This looks promising.
  - 93 - 54 = 39
  - Then 39 + 52 = 91
So, 93 - 54 + 52 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 93 - 54 + 52 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 77, 89, and 69 once each to get 81. Let's consider the possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's try to combine larger numbers since smaller numbers need to be used to compensate or get closer to 81.
- 89 - 77 = 12 (This is not close to 81)
- 89 - 69 = 20 (This also isn't close)
- 89 + 69 = 158 (This is too large)
Now, let's use the numbers in a different way:
- 77 + 69 = 146
- 146 - 89 = 57 (Still far from 81)
Let's try different combinations:
- 89 - 77 + 69 = 89 - 77 + 69 = 12 + 69 = 81
This combination gives us the desired result of 81.
</think>
<answer> 89 - 77 + 69 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 29, 34, and 77 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 82. Let's try different combinations:
1. Start with the largest number: 77. We need 1 more to reach 82.
   - 77 + 3 = 80 (we need 2 more to reach 82), and 77 + 29 doesn't work since 77 + 29 = 106
   - 77 + 34 = 111 (too high)
2. Trying 29 and 34 first:
   - 34 + 29 = 63 (19 more needed), and 29 + 77 = 106 (too high)
   - 34 + (29 - 77) is invalid since it would use 77 more than once
3. Trying to start with 34:
   - 34 + 77 = 111 (too high)
   - 34 + 29 = 63 (19 more needed), and we haven't used 77 yet
So far, none of these combinations seem to work. Let's try another approach:
34 + 77 - 29. When we calculate this, we get:
   34 + 77 = 111
   111 - 29 = 82
This works as it uses each number exactly once and gives us the result 82.
</think>
<answer> 34 + 77 - 29 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 29, 34, and 77 exactly once to get 82 using basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's look at how we can combine these numbers:
- Adding: 29 + 34 = 63, which is close to 82 but too low.
- Subtracting: 77 - 34 = 43, which is far from 82.
- Multiplying: None of the direct pairs give us 82: 29 * 34 = 986, 29 * 77 = 2273, 34 * 77 = 2618.
- Dividing: 77 / 34 = 2.294 (not close to 82), 34 / 29 = 1.172 (not close to 82), 29 / 77 = 0.377 (not close to 82).
Now, let's try combining them in different orders or adding another layer of arithmetic:
If we look closer, we might need to try a combination:
(77 - 34) + 29 = 43 + 29 = 72, which is still not 82.
Combining different operations:
(77 - (34 / 29)) is approximately 77 - 1.172 = 75.828, which is close but not there.
What if we rearrange:
(77 + 29) - 34 = 106 - 34 = 72 (still not 82).
Then we consider:
(77 + 29) + 34 - 4 = 106 + 34 - 4 = 136 - 4 = 132 (way too high).
Finally, we land on:
(77 + 34) - 29 = 111 - 29 = 82.
This works as we get 82 using all numbers exactly once.</think>
<answer> (77 + 34) - 29 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 38, 88, and 69 that equals 57. Let's try to use each number only once and use basic arithmetic operations.
Starting with the numbers, we can see that 88 - 69 = 19. This brings us closer to our target, 57.
Now we need another number to add to 19 to get 57. The difference between 57 and 19 is 38. Therefore, we can construct the equation as follows:
88 - 69 + 38 = 57
</think>
<answer> 88 - 69 + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 38, 88, and 69 exactly once to get 57. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
First, let's check if any combination of these operations can produce 57 directly or if we need to rearrange the numbers.
If we look at 38 + 88 = 126 and 126 - 69 = 57, this suggests we could use 38 + 88 - 69 to get 57.
To verify, let's do the calculation:
38 + 88 = 126
126 - 69 = 57
This gives us the correct result of 57, so the equation is 38 + 88 - 69.
</think>
<answer> 38 + 88 - 69 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 86, 67, 10, and 80 exactly once to get 27. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Adding or subtracting these numbers won't easily reach 27.
- Multiplying or dividing won't work well with these numbers either, as they aren't close to other simple products or quotients that lead to 27.
- We can try combining them in a way that does not immediately seem feasible. For instance, we could look at combinations like (86 - 67) plus or minus another number, but that doesn't work since it would be 19, which is too far from 27.
- If we take (86 - 67 - 10), we get 9, which still needs to incorporate 80 to reach 27.
- What if we rearrange: 86 - (67 - 10) + (80 / another number)? We only have 10 and 80 to use, and 80 / 10 = 8, which brings us closer to 27.
- Testing (86 - 67 + (80 / 10)) = 86 - 67 + 8 = 19 + 8 = 27.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 67 + 80 / 10) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 87, 39, and 34 exactly once to make 92 by using basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by looking at the target number and the numbers we have.
- The number we want to achieve is 92.
- We have: 87, 39, and 34.
If we add 39 and 34, we get 73. Now, to reach 92 from 73, we need to add 19. But 19 is not one of our numbers. However, we can express 19 as 87 - 68, but 68 isn't one of our numbers either. 
We can also try different combinations, but one effective way is to use the given numbers as follows:
34 + 39 - 87 = -14, which is not 92.
Let's try 87 - 39 + 34. This gives us 87 - 39 = 48, and then 48 + 34 = 82, which is not 92.
Another way to think about it is: 87 - 39 + 34 = 48 + 34 - 87 = 82 + 10 = 92.
Still not right, let’s check: 87 - (39 + 34) = 87 - 73 = 14, not 92.
We are close to finding the right combination: 87 + 39 - 34 = 92.
Therefore, the correct equation is 87 + 39 - 34 = 92.
</think>
<answer> 87 + 39 - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 21, 21, and 85, with each number used exactly once, using basic arithmetic operations.
Firstly, let's consider the possibility of subtraction or addition to get closer to 85.
21 + 21 = 42, which is less than 85, so let's try subtraction.
85 - 21 = 64, which is close, but not exactly 85.
If we use the other 21 in the equation, we need to think about multiplying or dividing 21 by itself or with 64 or 85 to get 85.
21 * 4 = 84, which is close to 85.
By adding 1 to 84 we can get 85.
So we use 85 - 21 + 21 * 4 + 1.
However, since we need the equation to only use each number once, and we already used the first 21 in subtraction, we need a different approach:
If we have 85 - (21 + 21 / 1) = 85 - (21 + 21) = 85 - 42 = 43, which is not 85.
Another thought is 21 * (21 / 21) + 85 = 21 * 1 + 85 = 21 + 85 = 106, which is too big.
Finally, let's use: 85 - 21 + 21 calculates to 64, leaving us 21 more to get 85.
Therefore, 85 = 21 + (85 - 21).
This equation uses each number exactly once and we need it to be simplified.
</think>
<answer> 21 + (85 - 21) </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 21, 21, and 85 to work with. We need to create an equation that equals 85 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider if we can add or subtract 21 from 85 to see if it uses all the numbers. 
85 - 21 = 64
This leaves us with the remaining number 21, but 64 is not our target.
Let's try another combination: 85 + 21 = 106
This also does not give us our target.
Now, let's consider multiplication and addition. We know:
21 * 4 = 84
This is close but we need 85. Let's see what happens if we add the last 21:
84 + 21 = 105
This is too large. So, let's try another combination:
21 * 4 + 21 = 105
This is also too large.
What if we consider division and addition instead?
21 * 4 = 84
Then we would add the last 21:
84 + 21 = 105
This is still too large.
Now, let's try division and subtraction:
21 - 21 = 0
This leaves us with 85, which is our target.
So, the equation is:
85 = 21 - 21 + 85
</think>
<answer> 21 - 21 + 85 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 14, 66, and 41 to make 39. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's check if any straightforward combination of these numbers directly gives us 39.
14 + 66 = 80 (too high)
14 + 41 = 55 (still too high)
66 + 41 = 107 (much too high)
14 - 66 = -52 (too low)
66 - 41 = 25 (too low)
41 - 14 = 27 (too low)
Now, let's try more complex combinations:
(66 + 41) / 14 = 107 / 14 = 7.64 (not an integer, so not 39)
(66 + 14) / 41 = 80 / 41 = 1.95 (not 39)
(41 + 14) / 66 = 55 / 66 = 0.82 (not 39)
(41 - 66) + 14 = -25 + 14 = -11 (not 39)
66 / (41 - 14) = 66 / 27 = 2.44 (not 39)
No immediate combination works except for:
14 + 66 - 41
14 + 66 - 41 = 14 + 25 = 39
So we have found the correct equation: 14 + 66 - 41 = 39. </think>
<answer> 14 + 66 - 41 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 74, 23, 46, and 71 exactly once to get 76. One way to approach this is to check for combinations of operations and small additions/subtractions that might lead us to the target number.
Let's try using subtraction and addition:
74 - 46 = 28
28 + 23 = 51
51 + 7 = 58 (this is still too low)
Let's try another approach:
74 - 23 = 51
51 + 46 = 97 (this is too high)
Let's try:
74 - 23 + 46 = 97 (too high)
Then let's try:
74 - 46 + 23 = 51 (this is still too low)
Now let's try another combination:
71 - 23 = 48
48 + 7 = 55 (this is still too low)
How about:
46 + 71 = 117 (too high)
Let's try:
71 - 46 = 25
25 + 23 = 48
48 + 7 = 55 (still too low)
Finally, let's try:
23 + 7 = 30
74 - 46 = 28
30 + 28 = 58 (still too low)
Now, let's try:
23 + 71 = 94
74 - 46 = 28
94 - 28 = 66 (too low)
Simplifying, I think the correct operation is:
71 - 46 + 23 = 48 + 23 = 71 (still too high)
Let me check one more differently:
74 - 23 = 51
71 - 46 = 25
51 + 25 = 76 !
So we find that 74 - 23 + 71 - 46 equals 76.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 23 + 71 - 46 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 28, 48, 32, and 46 that equals 34. Let's start by looking at possible combinations of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
- First, let's try combinations involving subtraction and addition to see if we can get close to 34.
- Subtracting 48 from 46 gives us -2, which is not helping.
- Subtracting 32 from 46 gives us 14, and if we subtract 28 from this result, we get 14 - 28 = -14, which is not 34.
- Adding 28 and 32 gives us 60, and removing 46 and 48 respectively leads to 60 - 46 - 48, which is a very large negative number and not 34.
- Adding 46 and 28 gives us 74, and subtracting 48 from it gives us 74 - 48 = 26, which is not 34.
- Adding 32 and 48 gives us 80, and subtracting 28 and 46 from it results in 80 - 28 - 46 = 36 - 28 = 8, which is not 34.
- Adding 46 and 32, and then subtracting 28 results in 78 - 28 = 50, again not 34.
- Subtracting 46 from 48 first gives us 2, and then adding 28 and 32 gives (48 - 46) + (28 + 32) = 2 + 60 = 62, which is not 34.
- Trying (48 - 32) + 28 = 16 + 28 = 44, which is not 34 either.
- If we compute (48 - 28) + 32, we get 20 + 32 = 52, not 34.
- From those combinations, none seem to work. Let me try a different approach.
- We notice that combining 48 and 46 gives 94, and when we subtract 32, we get 94 - 32 = 62, still not 34.
- Another observation is (48 - 32) + 28 = 16 + 28 = 44, which isn't 34.
- Finally, combining (46 - 32) + (28 + 48) = 14 + 76 = 90, which is still not 34.
- At this point, I see a potential solution: (46 - 32) + 28 = 14 + 28 = 42, but this doesn't work.
- But looking back, if we remove some decomposition errors, we realize (48 - (32 - 28)) = 48 - 4 = 44 also doesn't match.
- Actually, we see the answer, (48 - (32 - 28)) does not equal 34 but the correct pattern following given are (48 - (28 + 32 - 46)) fitting as it leaves us with 48 - 56 = -8.
- Finally, the correct equation should be: (48 - 32) - (28 - 46) = 16 + 18 = 34.
</think>
<answer> (48 - 32) - (28 - 46) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 53, 17, and 80 exactly once to get 44. 
- First, let's check if we can get close to 44 by using any combination of these numbers.
- Adding 53 and 17 gives us 70.
- Subtracting 80 from 53 gives us -27.
- 53 + 17 - 80 = 70 - 80 = -10.
It seems that direct addition and subtraction aren't working well.
- Now let's try another combination: 80 - 53 = 27.
- Then we can use 17 = 27 - 10.
But 10 isn't in the set, so we need to restart considering the operations.
- Let's try 80 - 17 = 63.
- Now consider dividing 53 by the result of the subtraction from 80 and 17: (80 - 17) / 53 = 63 / 53, which is approximately 1.2. This is far from 44.
- Since none of these direct combinations worked, let's rethink using parentheses to see if it helps.
- (80 - 53) + 17 = 27 + 17 = 44.
So, the equation that satisfies the condition is (80 - 53) + 17 = 44.
</think>
<answer> (80 - 53) + 17 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 59, 14, and 53 that equals 98. We can use basic arithmetic operations to achieve this.
First, let's try to see if we can use the numbers in a way that one of them can be combined with the result of operations on the other two.
If we look at 59 and 53, their sum is 112, which is close but too high. Subtracting 14 from 112 gives us 98, which is our target number.
So, 59 + 53 - 14 = 98.
</think>
<answer> (59 + 53) - 14 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 59, 14, and 53 exactly once to get 98. Let's first see if any simple addition or subtraction of these numbers can get us close to 98.
59 + 14 = 73
This is not close enough and we've only used two numbers.
Let's try multiplication:
59 * 1. 8 = 106. 2 (which isn't an integer and not 98)
Now let's try a different approach combining addition and subtraction:
59 - 53 = 6
6 + 14 = 20
This gives us 20, which is still not 98.
That seems to be missing the right combination of operations. Let's try another straightforward combination:
59 - 53 = 6
59 - 6 = 53 (already used)
14 + 53 = 67
This gives 67, not 98.
Finally, it seems the correct approach is:
59 - 53 = 6
14 + 53 = 67
59 - 67 (subtracted 67 from 59 which is -8)
This doesn't yield 98. Let's reconsider:
59 + 14 + 53 gives 126. 
126 - 28 = 98. But 28 is not one of the given numbers.
Another approach is:
14 * 53 = 742
59 + 53 = 112
742 - 112 = 630, not 98.
After trying many combinations, the right approach seems to be an error in initial assumptions. The correct calculation:
59 - 14 = 45
53 + 45 = 98
So the numbers used exactly are 59, 14, and 53.</think>
<answer> (59 - 14) + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 61, 97, and 75 exactly once to get 39. I'll start by considering which combination of these numbers, combined with the arithmetic operations, could give us 39.
Let's examine the possibilities:
1. 97 - 61 - 75 = -37 (Not 39)
2. 97 - 61 + 75 = 108 (Not 39)
3. 97 + 61 - 75 = 83 (Not 39)
4. 97 - (61 + 75) = -19 (Not 39)
5. (61 - 75) + 97 = -14 + 97 = 83 (Not 39)
6. 75 + 61 - 97 = 136 - 97 = 39 (This works! )
So, the equation that equals 39 is 75 + 61 - 97.
</think>
<answer> 75 + 61 - 97 </answer>

==============
<think> We have three numbers: 61, 97, and 75. We need to use these numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get 39. Each number can only be used once.
Let's try combinations:
1. 97 - 61 = 36 (not 39)
2. 97 - 75 = 22 (not 39)
3. 61 - 75 = -14 (not 39)
4. 97 + 75 = 172 (not 39)
5. 75 + 61 = 136 (not 39)
It seems combining the three numbers doesn't work. Let's try another approach by considering operations between pairs:
61 - 75 = -14 (not 39)
Now combining 97 with modifications:
97 - 75 = 22 (not 39)
Hmm, let's try addition between them and subtract from 61:
(61 + 75) - 97 = 136 - 97 = 39
This gives us the result we need.
</think>
<answer> (61 + 75) - 97 </answer>

==============
<think> We are given the numbers 70, 57, and 96. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 83 using these numbers only once and basic arithmetic operations.
Let's consider adding and subtracting these numbers first:
70 + 57 = 127
127 - 96 = 31
This is not 83, so let's try another combination:
70 - 57 = 13
96 - 13 = 83
This gives us the equation 96 - (70 - 57) = 83.
</think>
<answer> 96 - (70 - 57) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 34, 67, and 51 exactly once to get 84. Let's try different combinations of addition and subtraction:
1. One approach could be to find which numbers, when added or subtracted, get us close to 84.
2. If we consider 67 + 51, we get 118, which is too high.
3. If we consider 67 + 34, we get 101, which is also too high.
4. If we consider 51 + 34, we get 85, which is close but not exactly 84.
5. Now let's try 67 - 51 = 16 and then see if we can form 84 with 34.
6. If we add 34 to 16, we get 50, which is not 84.
7. Using the numbers provided again: try (67 - 34) + 51.
8. This evaluates to 33 + 51, which equals 84.
</think>
<answer> (67 - 34) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that uses the numbers 34, 67, and 51 exactly once to get 84. Let's try different combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
We can start with addition and subtraction:
34 + 67 = 101
101 - 51 = 50
This isn't 84. Let's try multiplication and addition:
34 * 51 = 1734
1734 - 67 = 1667
This isn't 84 either. 
Let's try another combination:
(67 + 51) - 34 = 84
Here, (67 + 51) = 118
Then, 118 - 34 = 84, and this gives us our result.
</think>
<answer> (67 + 51) - 34 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 11, 97, and 6 exactly once to make 80. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One way to approach this is to see if we can form a structure that might work, such as \( a + b + c = 80 \).
If we add 11 and 6, we get 17. Now we need to find a way to get 63 more to reach 80. So, we would need \( 97 - 17 = 80 \).
This means we can use the equation \( 11 + 6 + 97 \), but this includes multiplication or division, which isn't allowed.
Let's try another combination: \( 97 - 6 - 11 \).
When we calculate \( 97 - 6 - 11 \), we get \( 97 - 17 = 80 \).
Therefore, the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 6 - 11) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 11, 97, and 6 that equals 80. We can try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
- Start by looking at the numbers: 97 is close to 80, 11 and 6 can be used as factors or in simple addition/subtraction.
- Consider the equation: 97 - 11 + 6. 
  - This gives us 97 - 11 which is 86.
  - Adding 6 to 86 gives us 92.
This is close but not exactly 80. We need to adjust a bit.
- Now consider: (97 - 11) - 6. 
  - This simplifies to 86 - 6 which equals 80.
Therefore, the equation that uses the numbers 11, 97, and 6 to get 80 is (97 - 11) - 6.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 11) - 6 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 32, 57, and 60 using basic arithmetic operations to get 85. 
First, let's check if any straightforward addition or subtraction can work:
32 + 57 + 60 = 150 (too high)
60 + 57 + 32 = 149 (too high)
32 + 57 - 60 = 29 (too low)
32 + 60 - 57 = 35 (too low)
57 + 60 - 32 = 85 (this is the target)
So, 57 + 60 - 32 equals 85.
</think>
<answer> 57 + 60 - 32 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 14, 30, and 33 exactly once to get 77. Let's consider the operations available: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- If we multiply 30 and 33, we get 990, which is far from our target.
- If we divide 30 by 33, we get approximately 0. 909, which is too small to reach 77.
- If we just add or subtract we don't get 77.
- Let's combine these: If we take 30 and add 33 to it, we get 63. Now, to reach 77, we need to add 14 to 63.
So, 30 + 33 + 14 = 77
</think>
<answer> (30 + 33) + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 72, 50, and 69 exactly once to get 91. 
Let's try combining them with arithmetic operations.
First, consider the operations that can significantly change the numbers:
- Multiplication (72 * 1. 25 = 90) and division (72 / 8 = 9) seem promising since they can align closely to the target 91.
Considering addition and subtraction:
- 72 + 50 + 69 does not give us 91.
- 72 + 50 - 69 could be a possibility.
Calculating 72 + 50 - 69:
72 + 50 = 122
122 - 69 = 53
This does not yield 91.
Now, let's try a different combination:
- 69 + 50 - 72
69 + 50 = 119
119 - 72 = 47
This also does not give the right result.
Finally, let's try:
72 + (50 - 69)
50 - 69 = -19
72 - 19 = 53
This still doesn't work.
It seems we missed another possibility:
- 72 - (50 - 69)
50 - 69 = -19
72 - (-19) = 72 + 19 = 91
That gives us the solution.
</think>
<answer> 72 - (50 - 69) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 77, 66, and 88 that equals 55. Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
- Adding and subtracting: (77 - 66) + 88 = 11 + 88 = 99 (not 55)
- Using the 77 directly: 77 - 66 + 88 = 11 + 88 = 99 (not 55)
- Using multiplication and division: 88 / 66 * 77 = 1.37 * 77 = 106.69 (not 55)
- Another approach: (88 + 66) - 77 = 154 - 77 = 77 (not 55)
- Trying different combinations of operations: 77 + (66 - 88) = 77 + (-22) = 55
This combination gives us the desired result of 55.
</think>
<answer> 77 + (66 - 88) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 39, 90, 26, and 47 exactly once to get 30. One way to approach this is to check if any combination of these numbers, along with basic arithmetic operations, can yield the result 30.
Let's try different combinations:
- 39 - 90 - 26 - 47 = -114 (Not 30)
- 39 + 90 - 26 - 47 = 66 - 47 = 19 (Not 30)
- 90 - 39 - 26 - 47 = 51 - 47 = 4 (Not 30)
- 90 - 39 + 26 - 47 = 51 + 26 - 47 = 77 - 47 = 30 (This works)
Thus, we have found a combination that results in 30 using the provided numbers and operations.
</think>
<answer> 90 - 39 + 26 - 47 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 50, 25, and 38 exactly once to get 13. Let's explore combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Trying 50 - 25 + 38:
50 - 25 = 25
25 + 38 = 63 (This is too high)
Then, let's try 50 - (25 + 38):
50 - 25 = 25
25 - 38 = -13 (This is close, but we need a positive 13)
Then, let's try (50 - 38) - 25:
50 - 38 = 12
12 - 25 = -13 (This doesn't work)
Let's then consider if there's a combination using multiplication or division:
(50 ÷ 25) + 38:
50 ÷ 25 = 2
2 + 38 = 40 (This is too high)
None of these combinations seem to work. Let's try another approach:
(50 - 38) + (25 ÷ 50):
50 - 38 = 12
25 ÷ 50 = 0.5
12 + 0.5 = 12.5 (This is not correct)
Trying again, another approach:
(25 + 38) - 50:
25 + 38 = 63
63 - 50 = 13
The equation works with:
(25 + 38) - 50 = 13
</think>
<answer> (25 + 38) - 50 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 50, 25, and 38 to reach the result of 13. 
First, let's add 50 and 25 which gives us 75.
Now we have 75 + 38, which equals 113. 
This is not 13, so let's try another combination.
Next, let's try subtracting the largest number from the sum of the other two.
If we do 50 + 25 and then subtract 38, we get 75 - 38 = 37.
Still not 13, so let's try 25 + 38 - 50. This equals 13.
</think>
<answer> (25 + 38) - 50 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 47, 69, and 61 exactly once to get 55. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 69 - 47 = 22 (not 55)
- 69 + 47 = 116 (not 55)
- 61 + 47 = 108 (not 55)
- 69 + 61 = 130 (not 55)
- 61 - 47 = 14 (not 55)
- 69 - 61 = 8 (not 55)
Next, let's try some mixed operations:
- 69 - 47 + 61 = 83 (not 55)
- 69 + 47 - 61 = 55 (this looks promising)
We have found a combination that works: 69 + 47 - 61 = 55.
</think>
<answer> 69 + 47 - 61 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 50, 71, and 46 exactly once to make 75.
First, let's consider if we can get close to 75 by adding or subtracting these numbers.
71 - 46 = 25, which is not 75.
50 + 71 = 121, which is too high.
Let's try multiplication and division.
50 * 71 / 46 seems promising.
Let's calculate this: (50 * 71) / 46 = 3550 / 46 = 77.2143, which is not 75.
We should also try 71 + (50 / 46).
Let's calculate this: 71 + (50 / 46) = 71 + 1. 0869 ≈ 72, which is close but not 75.
So, using 71 + (50 - 46) might work:
71 + (50 - 46) = 71 + 4 = 75, which is exactly what we need.
</think>
<answer> 71 + (50 - 46) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 60, 12, and 38 exactly once to create an equation that equals 10. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Starting with subtraction: 60 - 12 - 38 = 10. However, we only get one digit (10) here, and we need to use all numbers. 
- Trying another combination: 60 - 38 - 12 = 6, which is not 10.
- Looking at division: 60 / 12 - 38 = 5 - 38 = -33, which is not 10.
- Now let's try a different combination: 60 - (12 + 38) = 60 - 50 = 10.
This combination seems promising. 60 - (12 + 38) correctly equals 10.
</think>
<answer> 60 - (12 + 38) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 28, 3, and 67 exactly once in an equation to make 98. Let's start by considering how we might combine these numbers.
- One way to approach this is to see if any direct operation can combine the numbers to get closer to 98.
- Adding or subtracting will not get us to 98 with only these numbers.
- Multiplying and dividing could be useful.
- If we divide 67 by 3, we get 22.333..., which isn't 98.
- If we multiply 28 by 3, we get 84, which is close but too low.
- Now let's try: 28 + (67 / 3) = 28 + 22.333... = 50.333..., which is still not 98.
- Let's try another combination: 67 - 3 = 64, and then 98 - 64 = 34, and finally 28 + 3 = 31, which is not aligning to 98.
- Another attempt could be: (67 + 3) - 28 = 70 - 28 = 42, which is too low.
- A combination that appears promising is: (67 + 28) - 3 = 95 - 3 = 92. This is 6 short of 98.
- Thus, the final combination seems to be: (67 + 28) - 3 = 95 - 3 = 92. Add the 6 from 3, so our final equation is 67 + 28 + 3 = 98.
 </think>
<answer> 67 + 28 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 47, 69, and 79 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 37. 
Let's first consider what kind of combination might work. We see that the difference between 79 and 69 is 10, and then we need to get 37 from the numbers. We can try 79 - 69 - 47 or 79 - 69 + 47. 
If we try 79 - 69 - 47, we get -37, which is not what we want. 
Now, let's try 79 - 69 + 47. We get:
79 - 69 = 10
10 + 47 = 57
This doesn't give us 37 either.
Now let's try another combination: 79 - 47 - 69. We get:
79 - 47 = 32
32 - 69 = -37
This also doesn't work. 
We already know 79 - 69 + 47 is ruled out. Let's try one more: 47 + 69 - 79. We get:
47 + 69 = 116
116 - 79 = 37
This satisfies our condition as all the numbers 47, 69, and 79 are used exactly once and the equation gives us 37.
</think>
<answer> 47 + 69 - 79 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 16 using the numbers 1, 70, 2, and 57 exactly once, we need to consider different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
One possible approach is to use subtraction and addition.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 70 - 57 + 2 + 1: This equals 16.
2. 57 - 70 + 2 + 1: This equals -5, which is not 16.
3. 70 - (57 + 2 + 1): This equals 10, which is not 16.
From the above, the combination 70 - 57 + 2 + 1 equals 16.
</think>
<answer> 70 - 57 + 2 + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 64, 35, 22, and 72 exactly once to make 21. One way to approach this is to consider small differences or additions/subtractions that might result in 21.
Let's start with 64 - 43:
64 - 43 = 21
But 43 isn't a number we have. Let's try 64 - 35:
64 - 35 = 29
Not 21. Next, let's try 64 - 35 + 7:
64 - 35 + 7 = 36
Still not 21. Now let's try 72 - 51:
72 - 51 = 21
We have 51 using 64 - 35 + 7, so let's subtract 35 from 51:
51 - 35 = 16
So the only number left is 22. Let's see if we can use 22 correctly. We can see 21 = 72 - 64 + 35 - 22 fits:
72 - 64 + 35 - 22 = 21
</think>
<answer> 72 - 64 + 35 - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> We have three numbers: 67, 65, and 31. We need to create an equation that equals 33 using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider the possibility of using subtraction and addition:
67 - 65 = 2
With the result of 2, we need to make 2 + some number = 33. So, 33 - 2 = 31.
Now we see that 31 is one of our numbers, so we can use it directly.
Therefore, the equation is:
67 - 65 + 31 = 33
</think>
<answer> (67 - 65) + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 23, 72, 84, and 9 exactly once to get 44. Let's try different combinations of operations.
First, let's consider if we can use subtraction or addition to get closer to 44.
We can try: 84 - 72 = 12, which is not 44.
Then, 84 - (72 + 9) = 84 - 81 = 3, which is still not 44.
Now, let's consider if we can use division or multiplication:
84 / 9 = 9.33, which is not an integer and won't work.
(84 + 9) / 72 = 93 / 72 is not 44.
Then, let's try 72 / 9 = 8.
Now, we have 84 - 23 = 61.
Next, let's see 61 + 8: 61 + 8 = 69.
This doesn't work, so let's try rearranging terms.
72 - 23 = 49, and 49 + 9 = 58.
None of the above options are correct.
Now let's consider an alternative path: 84 - 72 = 12, then we might have 23 + 9 which equals 32, but that doesn't work to reach 44.
And, another approach is by combining all: 
84 - 72 + 9 + 23 = 12 + 9 + 23 = 21 + 23 = 44.
So, this combination finally works.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 72 + 9 + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 96, 2, 27, and 8 exactly once to get 79. Let's try different combinations of operations:
1. We can start by trying to use multiplication or division to get a high number and then add/subtract smaller numbers.
2. If we look at 96, using 8 as a factor could be useful, since \(96 / 8 = 12\).
3. Now we need 67 more (79 - 12 = 67), using the remaining numbers 2 and 27.
4. If we take 27 - 2 = 25, then adding 42 (96 - 54 where 54 could be 27 + 27) would give us 67.
5. So let's try \(96 - (27 + 2)\) and then add 40 (2 * 20, and 20 is 27 - 7, but 7 not available).
6. A simpler approach could be \(96 - 27 - 2 + 8\).
7. If we calculate: \(96 - 27 - 2 + 8 = 76 - 2 = 74 + 5 = 79\).
This doesn't look right, so let's rethink easier combinations.
8. Another simpler try: \(96 - 27 - 8 + 2 = 60 - 6 = 54 + 5 = 29\) (doesn't work, this was an overcomplication).
Actually, just by rearranging simpler combinations, \(96 - 27 + 2 + 8 = 69 + 10 = 69 + 1 = 70 + 9 = 79\).
The correct easy way is:
96 - 27 + 2 + 8 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 27 + 2 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 84, 20, and 24 exactly once each to get a result of 80. Let's consider some combinations:
- 84 - 20 - 24 = 39 (too low)
- 84 - 20 + 24 = 88 (too high)
- 84 + 20 - 24 = 80 (this could be the correct combination)
So, 84 + 20 - 24 equals 80.
</think>
<answer> (84 + 20) - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 84, 20, and 24 exactly once to get 80. Let's start by looking at possible combinations:
- 84 - 20 = 64, which is far from 80.
- 84 - 24 = 60, which is still not 80.
- 84 - 20 - 24 = 40 - 24 = 16, which is too small.
- 84 - (20 + 24) = 84 - 44 = 40, which is still not 80.
- Let's try a different combination: 84 + 20 - 24 = 104 - 24 = 80, which is exactly what we need.
Thus, the equation that equals 80 using the numbers 84, 20, and 24 exactly once is 84 + 20 - 24. </think>
<answer> (84 + 20) - 24 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 56, 9, 6, and 4 exactly once to get 86. Let's try different combinations of operations.
First, let's consider that 56 is a relatively large number, so we might need to use subtraction.
If we subtract 9, 6, and 4 from 56, we get:
56 - 9 - 6 - 4 = 37
This is not 86, so we need to think further.
We can try combining these numbers in other ways. Let's try adding some of them and subtracting the rest:
56 - 9 + 6 + 4 = 56 - 9 + (6 + 4) = 47 + 10 = 57
Still not 86, so let's try different combinations:
56 + 9 - 6 + 4 = 65 - 6 + 4 = 59 + 4 = 63
This is also not 86. Let's try another approach:
(56 - 9 - 6) * 4 = 41 * 4 = 164 which is too big.
Let's re-examine all possibilities:
(56 - 9 + 6) * 4 = 43 * 4 = 172 which is too big.
Now, let's check if there's a combination that can lead us to 86:
(56 + 9) - 6 + 4 = 65 - 6 + 4 = 59 + 4 = 63
None of these worked. Let's try a different approach:
(56 + 9 - 6) * 4 / 2 = 59 * 4 / 2 = 236 / 2 = 118
We still don't get 86. At this point, let's check a different combination:
56 - (9 * 6) + 4 = 56 - 54 + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6
Not correct either. Let's try:
56 - 6 + (9 * 4) = 50 + 36 = 86
This combination works as it gives us 86.
</think>
<answer> 56 - 6 + (9 * 4) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 99 using the numbers 42, 55, and 86 exactly once, I need to consider the operations we can use. 
First, let's look at the numbers and see if any straightforward addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division gives us 99:
- 42 + 55 + 86 = 183 (too high)
- 55 + 86 - 42 = 99 (this looks promising)
- 86 + 42 + 55 = 183 (too high again)
- 86 - 42 + 55 = 99 (also works)
Therefore, we have a couple of possible equations:
55 + 86 - 42 = 99
86 - 42 + 55 = 99
Since the problem doesn't specify a unique solution, we can choose either one. Let's go with the first one as an example.
</think>
<answer> 55 + 86 - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 42, 55, and 86 exactly once to get 99. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's see if we can use addition or subtraction:
- 42 + 55 + 86 = 183 (too high)
- 42 + 55 - 86 = 11 (too low)
- 86 + 42 + 55 = 183 (too high)
- 86 + 55 - 42 = 99 (this looks promising)
So, using the numbers 86, 55, and subtracting 42 gives us 99.
</think>
<answer> 86 + 55 - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 42, 55, and 86 exactly once to get 99. Let's try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
One possible approach is to add or subtract the two smaller numbers to get closer to the target number and then use the remaining number to reach the exact result.
Let's try: 55 + 42 - 86 = 99.
55 + 42 = 97
97 - 86 = 9
But this gives 9 instead of 99. Let's try another combination.
Considering 86 - 42 = 44, we add the remaining number 55 to get 99.
86 - 42 = 44
44 + 55 = 99
So the equation is 86 - 42 + 55 = 99.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 42) + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 34, 26, and 89 exactly once to get 97. Let's try different combinations of addition and subtraction:
1. 89 + 26 = 115 (not 97)
2. 89 + 34 = 123 (not 97)
3. 89 - 34 = 55 (not close to 97)
4. 89 - 26 = 63 (not 97)
5. 34 + 26 = 60 (not 97)
6. 34 + 89 = 123 (not 97)
7. 26 + 34 = 60 (not 97)
8. 34 - 26 = 8 (not 97)
9. 26 - 34 = -8 (too negative)
It seems none of these straightforward combinations work. Let's try a different approach:
34 + 89 - 26 = 97
This seems promising. Let's check:
34 + 89 equals 123, and then subtracting 26 from 123 gives us 97.
</think>
<answer> (34 + 89) - 26 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 24, 29, and 67 exactly once to get 62. 
One approach is to try combining the numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try: 67 - 29 - 24
This equals 67 - 29 = 38, and then 38 - 24 = 14.
That doesn't give us 62.
Now let's try: 67 + 29 - 24
This equals 67 + 29 = 96, and then 96 - 24 = 72.
Still not correct.
Now let's try: 67 - (29 - 24)
This is 67 - 5 = 62, which is exactly what we want.
So the correct equation is 67 - (29 - 24) = 62.
</think>
<answer> 67 - (29 - 24) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 7, 78, and 14 exactly once to get 85. Let's try different combinations of the operations.
First, let's consider multiplication and addition: (78 * 14) - 7 doesn't work as it equals 1095 which is too high.
Now, let's try: 78 - 7 + 14. This simplifies to 78 + 7 + 14 = 99, which is also too high.
Next, let's try: 78 + 7 - 14 = 71, which is lower. 
Lastly, let's try 78 + (7 * 14). Calculating inside the parentheses first gives us 7 * 14 = 98. Adding this to 78 gives us 78 + 98 = 176, which is too high.
Finally, let's try 78 + 14 - 7. This equals 85.
So the correct equation is 78 + 14 - 7 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 78 + 14 - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 66, 53, and 36 that equals 83. We can use basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by looking at the numbers and trying to combine them in different ways.
First, let's consider if we can get close to 83 with smaller numbers and then add/subtract the remaining number.
66 + 53 = 119
This is too high. Now let's try:
66 + 36 = 102
This is also too high. Next, let's try using substraction:
66 - 53 = 13
Now if we add 36 to this result:
13 + 36 = 49
That is still not enough. Let's try the other order round of substraction:
53 - 36 = 17
And then add 66:
17 + 66 = 83
This equals 83. </think>
<answer> (53 - 36) + 66 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 1, 5, 19, and 91 only once along with basic arithmetic operations to get 68. 
Let's try different combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
1 + 5 + 19 + 91 doesn't work as it equals 116.
1 * 5 * 19 * 91 also overflows beyond 68.
91 + 5 + 19 + 1 doesn't equal 68.
91 * 5 + 19 + 1 equals 456 which is too big.
(91 + 19) * 1 + 5 = 110 + 5 = 115 which is too big.
Let's try: 91 * 1 + 5 + 19 
This equals 105 which is too big.
(91 + 19) + 5 + 1 = 108 which is too big.
Now, let's try a different combination: 91 - 19 + 5 + 1
This equals 78 + 5 + 1 = 84 which is also too big.
An interesting observation is that 91 - 19 = 72. 
Then we need 6 more to make it 68.
So (91 - 19) - (5 - 1) equals 72 - 4 = 68.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 19) - (5 - 1) </answer>

<think> We need to use the numbers 70, 44, and 74 exactly once to make the equation equal 48. Let's try different combinations of basic operations.
First, let's try to add or subtract the numbers:
- Adding: 70 + 44 + 74 = 188 (not 48)
- Subtracting: 70 - 44 - 74 = -48 (close, but not equal)
Next, let's try mixing operations:
- 74 - 70 + 44 = 48 (this works)
So, the equation is 74 - 70 + 44 = 48.
</think>
<answer> 74 - 70 + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 20, 39, and 82 exactly once to get 63 using the basic arithmetic operations. 
Let's start by looking at the operations we can perform:
1. Addition: 20 + 39 + 82 = 141 (too high)
2. Subtraction: 39 - 20 + 82 = 101 (too high)
3. Multiplication: 20 * 39 * 82/100 is not possible as we cannot use all numbers once.
4. Division: 82 / 20 + 39 = 4.1 + 39 = 43 (too low)
Given these trial calculations, let’s try a combination.
Let's try: 82 - 39 + 20
82 - 39 = 43
43 + 20 = 63
This gives us the correct result 63 using all the numbers once.
</think>
<answer> 82 - 39 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 26, 59, and 16 exactly once to make 49. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- First, let's see if we can get close to 49 by adding and subtracting the numbers.
- 26 + 59 = 85, which is too high.
- 59 + 16 = 75, which is also too high.
- 26 + 59 - 16 = 69, which is still too high.
- Now let's try multiplication and division:
- 59 * 16 = 944 (this is very far from 49)
- 59 * 16 / 26 = 35. 38 (this isn't close enough)
Since the direct operations are not working as expected, let's try different combinations:
- 59 - 26 = 33
- We need 16 more to reach 49, so 33 + 16 = 49
We found a combination that works: 59 - 26 + 16 = 49.
</think>
<answer> (59 - 26) + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 13, 22, and 61 exactly once to get 52 using basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's see if we can get close to 52 by different combinations:
1. 61 - 22 + 13 = 52 (This seems promising)
Checking each step:
- 61 - 22 = 39
- 39 + 13 = 52
So, the equation is 61 - 22 + 13 = 52.
</think>
<answer> 61 - 22 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 76, 47, and 99 exactly once to get a result of 70 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
- 76 - 47 - 99 = -76 (too low)
- 76 - 47 + 99 = 128 (too high)
- 76 + 47 - 99 = 24 (too low)
- 76 + 99 - 47 = 128 - 47 = 81 (too high)
- 99 + 47 - 76 = 146 - 76 = 70 (this could work)
So the equation 99 + 47 - 76 equals 70.
</think>
<answer> 99 + 47 - 76 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 87, 91, and 63 exactly once to get the result 67. We can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Let's try different combinations:
- 91 - 87 = 4, and then finding a way to get to 67 from 4 and 63 doesn't seem plausible.
- 91 + 63 = 154, which is too high.
- 87 - 63 = 24, and then finding a way to get to 67 from 24 and 91 doesn't seem plausible.
- 63 + 91 = 154, which is too high too.
Now, let's try:
- 91 - 63 = 28
- Then we need 39 more to get to 67. 
- We can get 39 by using 91 - 87 = 4, and then 91 - (87 - 63) = 91 - 24 = 67.
So the equation is 91 - (87 - 63) = 67.
</think>
<answer> 91 - (87 - 63) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 51, 56, and 13 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 18. 
First, let's try to add and subtract these numbers but rearranging them to see if we can get 18.
1. Trying 56 - 51 = 5, which doesn't work.
2. Then 56 - 13 = 43, which doesn't work either.
3. Let's try 51 - 13 = 38, which also doesn't work.
4. Now, let's try a different combination: 56 + 13 = 69 and 69 - 51 = 18.
This does give us 18, and all the numbers are used exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 56 + 13 - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 51, 56, and 13 that equals 18. Each number can only be used once. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
- First, let's try subtraction: 56 - 51 = 5, which is not 18.
- Then, subtract 13 from 56: 56 - 13 = 43, still not 18.
- Adding 51 and 13 gives us 64, far from 18.
- Now, let's consider multiplication and subtraction: 56 * 13 = 728, which is far from 18.
- Next, let's try division: 51 / 13 = 3.923 (not an integer), so that's not valid.
- Finally, let's try 56 - (51 / 13): 56 - (51 / 13) = 56 - 3.923 = 52.077, also not equal to 18.
- Another way to see this is by rearranging: (56 - 51) + 13 = 5 + 13 = 18. This seems promising.
</think>
<answer> (56 - 51) + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 51, 56, and 13 exactly once to get 18. Let's consider multiplying and dividing first as they can help in getting closer to 18.
56 * 13 = 728 (too high)
51 * 13 = 663 (far too high)
56 / 13 = 4.307692 (not an integer, and not close to 18)
51 / 13 = 3.923077 (not an integer, and not close to 18)
Now let's consider addition and subtraction:
56 + 13 - 51 = 18 (this works)
So, the equation that equals 18 using the numbers 51, 56, and 13 is 56 + 13 - 51.
</think>
<answer> 56 + 13 - 51 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 79, 81, and 87 exactly once to make 85 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try combinations:
- 87 - 81 = 6 (too low)
- 87 - 79 = 8 (still too high)
- 87 - 79 + 81 = 99 (too high)
- 81 - 79 = 2 (too low)
- 81 + 2 + 77 = 80 (too low)
- 81 + 87 - 79 = 99 (too high)
Let's try another approach:
- 87 + 79 = 166 (too high)
- 87 + 81 - 79 = 99 (too high)
- 81 - 79 + 87 = 99 (too high)
Now, let's try this:
- (87 - 79) + 81 = 8 + 81 = 89 (too high)
- 87 + (81 - 79) = 87 + 2 = 89 (too high)
It seems none of the above combinations work directly. Let's do another check:
- 87 - (81 - 79) = 87 - 2 = 85
This combination gives us the correct result. So the equation is 87 - (81 - 79) = 85.
</think>
<answer> 87 - (81 - 79) </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 79, 81, and 87. We need to use each number exactly once and any combination of the arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 85.
Let's try some combinations:
- 87 - 81 = 6 (this is not 85)
- 87 - 79 = 8 (this is not 85)
- 81 - 79 = 2 (this is not 85)
- 87 + 79 = 166 (this is not 85)
- 87 + 81 = 168 (this is not 85)
- 81 + 79 = 160 (this is not 85)
- 87 - 81 + 79 = 85 (this equals 85)
So, the equation that works is 87 - 81 + 79 = 85.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 81 + 79 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 73, 49, and 65 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get the result 89.
Let's try adding and subtracting the numbers:
73 + 49 + 65 = 187 (which is too high)
73 + 49 - 65 = 67 (which is too low)
Let's try using multiplication or division:
73 * 49 / 65 = 55. 58 (which is not an integer and doesn't work)
73 - (49 * 65) / 100 doesn't fit our requirement as 49 * 65 = 3185, which is a large number and not possible in the problem's constraints.
Trying combinations of the numbers directly adding and subtracting:
73 + 65 - 49 = 91 (which is too high)
73 - 65 + 49 = 57 (which is too low)
None of these combinations work. Let's try a different approach:
65 + 49 - 73 = 21 (which is too low)
65 - 49 + 73 = 99 (which is too high)
There seems to be an oversight: the first combination directly tried 73 - (49 * 65) / 100 isn't feasible since 49 * 65 doesn't leave room for integer division here.
So, none of these straightforward combinations work. Let's reassess and additionally try:
(73 - 49) + 65 = 89! This works!
</think>
<answer> (73 - 49) + 65 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to find a combination of the numbers 31, 19, 70, and 40 using basic arithmetic operations to get 98. Let's try to add and subtract the numbers first:
31 + 19 = 50
Now we need 48 more to reach 98:
50 + 48 = 98
We see that 70 - 40 = 30, which is not correct. So let’s try some multiplications and additions/subtractions together.
70 + 19 = 89
40 - 31 = 9
89 + 9 = 98
So the equation that works is 70 + (40 - 31) + 19 = 98 </think>
<answer> 70 + (40 - 31) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 34, 96, 28, and 35 exactly once to get 55. Let's try to combine them in different ways with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to start could be to see if we can subtract and add numbers to get close to 55. If we subtract 35 from 96, we get 61. Then, if we add 34 to this result, we get 95, which is still too high. But if we subtract 34 from 95, we get 61 again, which isn't right.
Let's try another combination: 96 - 35 - 28. This gives us 33. Now, we need 22 more to reach 55. We can get 22 from 34 - 12, but 12 is not directly available. So, let's try 34 - 35 + 28 which gives us 27, still not 22.
Another method is using 35 - 28 + 96, which equals 103, which is too high. Then 96 - 35 + 28 equals 99, still too high. 
Finally, let's try 96 - 35 - 34 + 28. This simplifies to 55.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 35 - 34 + 28 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 66, 53, and 36 that equals 83. Let's try different combinations:
- 66 + 53 + 36 = 155 (too high)
- 66 + 53 - 36 = 83 (this could be the right combination)
- 66 + 36 - 53 = 53 (too low)
- 53 + 36 - 66 = 23 (too low)
- 66 - 53 + 36 = 53 (too low)
From the above combinations, we can see that 66 + 53 - 36 = 83.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 53 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 66, 53, and 36 exactly once to get the result of 83. 
One way to approach this is to consider the basic arithmetic operations and try different combinations.
Let's start by adding two of the numbers and then subtracting the third.
66 + 53 = 119
119 - 36 = 83
We have used the numbers 66 and 53 to get 119, and then subtracting 36 from 119 gives us 83.
This combination satisfies the requirement of using each number exactly once and achieving the target result.
</think>
<answer> 66 + 53 - 36 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 66, 53, and 36 exactly once to get the result of 83. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One possible approach is to see if we can combine these numbers in a way that one of them can be subtracted or added in a manner that other combinations of the remaining numbers can give us 83.
Let's try: 
66 + 36 - 53
This would give us:
66 + 36 = 102
102 - 53 = 49
This is closer, but not 83. 
Another approach could be:
(66 - 36) + 53
This would give us:
66 - 36 = 30
30 + 53 = 83
This calculation gives us the desired result of 83.
</think>
<answer> (66 - 36) + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 14, 69, and 3 that equals 80. Let's try different combinations of operations:
14 + 69 + 3 = 86 (not 80)
14 + 69 - 3 = 70 (not 80)
14 + 3 - 69 = -52 (not 80)
69 + 3 - 14 = 58 (not 80)
69 - 14 - 3 = 52 (not 80)
69 - 14 + 3 = 58 (not 80)
14 * 69 + 3 = 965 (too high)
69 * 3 + 14 = 211 (too high)
But if we rearrange:
(69 + 14) * 3 = 80 * 3 = 240 (too high)
Another possibility:
69 - (14 * 3) = 69 - 42 = 27 (not 80)
Finally, let's try:
(69 - 14) + 3 = 55 (not 80)
The most promising we had was:
69 - (14 * 3) = 27 (again not 80)
It seems I missed a simpler combination initially:
69 - 14 + 3 = 58 (not 80)
69 - 14 - 3 = 52 (not 80)
69 + 3 - 14 = 58 (not 80)
Finally, the correct combination turned out to be:
69 - 14 + 3 = 58 (which I initially missed during my rearrangement attempt)
Using the correct set of numbers and operations:
14 + 69 = 83 (close)
69 - 14 = 55 (subtracted later)
(69 + 3) - 14
Let's check it step by step:
69 + 3 = 72
Then 72 - 14 = 58 (still not 80)
But we can adjust:
14 + 69 - 3 = 70
Now adding:
14 + 69 - 3 = 80
This equation works correctly when we perform the operations.
</think>
<answer> (14 + 69) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 45, 43, and 40 with basic arithmetic operations to get 42. 
- First, let's look at the differences and sums between these numbers to see if we can reach 42.
- 45 - 43 = 2, which is not 42.
- 45 - 40 = 5, which is not 42.
- 43 - 40 = 3, which is not 42.
- 45 + 40 = 85, which is not 42.
- 45 + 43 = 88, which is not 42.
- 43 + 40 = 83, which is not 42.
- Now let's try combinations:
  - (45 - 43) + 40 = 2 + 40 = 42, which is what we want.
So, the equation that works is (45 - 43) + 40 = 42.
</think>
<answer> (45 - 43) + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation that equals 16 using the numbers 67, 25, and 76 exactly once. Let's try to use the operations in a way that can potentially work.
- First, let's consider subtraction: 67 - 25 = 42, which doesn't lead us to 16.
- Next, let's try addition. 67 + 25 = 92, which is too high.
- Now, let's try multiplication or division. If we divide, we could try 76 / 25 = 3.04, which isn't an integer and doesn't work. If we multiply, 67 * 25 = 1675, which is also incorrect.
- Considering addition and subtraction again might provide an easier path. 76 - 67 = 9, and then we need 7 more to reach 16. But 76 + 25 doesn't provide 7.
- Let's try 76 - (67 + 25) to see if we can use the numbers in a different combination. Performing the inner operation first, we get 76 - 92 = -16. This is very close but still negative.
- Now, reversing that and using 25 + 67 - 76 which equals 16. 
25 + 67 - 76 = 25 + 21 = 46 - 76 = 16.
</think>
<answer> 25 + 67 - 76 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation using the numbers 67, 25, and 76 that equals 16. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations:
- Adding and subtracting doesn't seem to get us to 16.
- Multiplying and dividing the numbers stand out.
Let's try: 76 - 67 - 25
76 - 67 = 9
9 - 25 = -16
This isn't what we want.
Next, let's try: 76 - 67 + 25
76 - 67 = 9
9 + 25 = 34
This is still not 16.
Let's try another approach: 76 - (67 + 25)
First, calculate 67 + 25 = 92
Then, 76 - 92 = -16
This is close but doesn't give us 16.
We should also try: 67 - (76 - 25)
76 - 25 = 51
Then, 67 - 51 = 16
This matches our target number 16.
So, the equation that works is 67 - (76 - 25) which is equal to 16.
</think>
<answer> 67 - (76 - 25) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 31, 49, and 68 exactly once with the arithmetic operations to get 86. First, let's consider addition and subtraction to see if we can get close to 86:
- Adding 31 and 49 gives us 80, and then adding 68 to that would give us 150, which is too high.
- Adding 31 and 68 gives us 99, and then adding 49 to that would give us 148, which is also too high.
- Adding 49 and 68 gives us 117, which is too high as well.
Now, let's try subtraction:
- Subtracting 31 from 49 gives us 18, and then subtracting 68 from that would give us -50, which is too low.
- Subtracting 31 from 68 gives us 37, and then subtracting 49 from that would give us -12, which is also too low.
We try a combination of addition and subtraction:
- Subtracting 31 from 49 gives us 18, and then adding 68 to that would give us 86.
So the equation would be: 49 - 31 + 68 = 86.
</think>
<answer> 49 - 31 + 68 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 10, 19, and 56 exactly once, along with the basic arithmetic operations to get 65. Let's try different combinations:
1. 56 - 10 - 19 = 27 (Not 65)
2. 56 - 10 + 19 = 65 (This looks promising)
3. Checking other combinations like 56 + 10 - 19 and 19 + 56 - 10 do not yield 65.
So, the correct equation seems to be 56 - 10 + 19 = 65.
</think>
<answer> 56 - 10 + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation using the numbers 8, 88, and 84 that equals 12. Each number can only be used once.
One way to approach this is to consider the operations available: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try multiplication and division in different combinations:
88 * 8 = 704 (This is too large)
84 * 8 = 672 (This is also too large)
88 / 8 = 11 (This is close but not equal to 12)
84 / 8 = 10. 5 (This is not an integer and also not equal to 12)
Now let's try another combination:
88 - 84 = 4 (This is not equal to 12)
Maybe we can use addition and subtraction:
8 + 84 / 8 = 8 + 10. 5 = 18. 5 (This is not equal to 12)
We can also try:
88 / 8 - 4 = 11 - 4 = 7 (This is not equal to 12)
Another possibility is:
88 - 84 + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12 (This is the right answer)
So, the equation that works is 88 - 84 + 8 = 12.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 84 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 8, 88, and 84 exactly once to make an equation that equals 12. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Adding them together: 8 + 88 + 84 = 180 (too large)
- Subtracting: There doesn't seem to be a combination that works.
- Multiplying: 88 * 84 / 8 = 912 (also too large)
Let's try a combination of operations:
(88 - 84) / 8 = 4 / 8 = 0.5 (not 12)
Now, let's try another combination:
88 - (84 / 8) = 88 - 10.5 = 77.5 (not 12)
One final combination I haven't tried:
88 / 8 - 84 = 11 - 84 = -73 (not 12)
Now, a successful combination:
(88 - 84) + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12
This satisfies the requirement.
</think>
<answer> (88 - 84) + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 66, 80, and 64 exactly once to make the expression equal to 50.
First, let's add 80 and 64: 80 + 64 = 144
Now, we need 50 and we have 144, so subtracting might not work. Let's try other combinations.
Next, let's consider multiplication or division. If we divide 80 by 66, we get approximately 1.21, which is not helpful.
Let's try another combination: If we subtract 64 from 80, we get 16, and then add 66: 80 - 64 + 66 = 82, which is too high.
Given that, let's try 66 + (80 / 64): 66 + (80 / 64) = 66 + 1.25 = 67.25, which is close but not exact.
Finally, we can consider 66 + (80 - 64) = 66 + 16 = 82, which is still too high.
Let's try 66 + 80 - 64 = 82, which was our previous incorrect high.
The only logical combination that makes sense here is 80 - 64 + 66. But this equals 82, still not 50.
Given the constraint of using each number only once, and the exact fit, the correct approach was identified.
Combining 66 and 80 directly doesn't give the necessary result without exceeding 50.
So, the correct combination seems to be: (80 - 64) + 66 = 20 + 66 = 86, which still isn't correct.
The intermediate step calculation showed 80 - 64 = 16, and then 66 + 16 = 82 was incorrect but breaking it out made it clearer.
97 doesn't work because of the 6 repeated, and 12 is incorrect again.
Finally upon proper analysis 66 - 80 + 64 = 50 which works.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 80 + 64 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 81, 4, and 12 exactly once to get 27. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- First, let's try using subtraction: 81 - 4 - 12 = 65 (not 27)
- Then, let's try addition: 81 + 4 + 12 = 97 (not 27)
- Now, let's try multiplication and division: 81 * 4 / 12 = 27 (this seems promising)
Let's verify: 81 * 4 / 12 = 324 / 12 = 27
So, the equation that works is 81 * 4 / 12 = 27.
</think>
<answer> 81 * 4 / 12 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation using the numbers 39, 15, and 63 which equals 87. Let's consider all possible combinations of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
1. 63 + 15 + 39 = 117 (which is not 87)
2. 63 + 39 - 15 = 87 (This seems promising)
3. 63 - 39 + 15 or 39 - 63 + 15 or 15 - 39 + 63 or 15 + 39 - 63 or 63 + 15 - 39 would not result in 87
So, 63 + 39 - 15 is the equation that equals 87.
</think>
<answer> 63 + 39 - 15 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 87, 60, and 61 exactly once to get 34. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
One approach could be to see if a combination of these numbers can yield 34 when used with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
- First, let's try to see if we can use subtraction: 87 - 60 = 27, which is too high.
- Then, let's try 87 - 61 = 26, still too high.
- Next, we try 87 - 60 = 27 (again), no luck here either.
- Now, let's try 61 - 60 = 1, which is too small.
- We then consider combinations like 61 - 87 and 60 - 87 but both these result in negative numbers, which we don't want.
- Let's try a mixed operation, like 87 - 61 - 60: This doesn't give us anything useful.
- Let's try multiplication or division. 60 * 61 / 87 does not work out as it results in a decimal number.
- Let's try another approach: 87 - 61 - 60 does not work either.
After trying all possible basic operations combinations, it doesn't seem right to proceed with other operations like this.
The best approach might be to start with 61, then subtract some other number from it using 60 or 87.
Try subtracting 61 - 87 + 60: This equals -15 + 60 which is 45.
Now try 61 - 87 - 60 = -15 - 60 = -75. This doesn't work.
Next is 87 - 60 - 61 = 27 - 61 = -34.
The most promising seems to be 61 - (60 + 87 / 3) but 3 isn't available.
Therefore, the combination that works is 61 - (87 - 60) = 61 - 27 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 61 - (87 - 60) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 87, 60, and 61 exactly once to get 34 using basic arithmetic operations. 
First, let's consider adding and subtracting these numbers:
- 87 + 60 + 61 = 208 (too high)
- 87 + 60 - 61 = 86 (too high)
- 87 + 61 - 60 = 88 (too high)
- 60 + 61 + 87 = 208 (too high)
- 60 + 61 - 87 = 34 (this is what we want)
- 61 + 60 - 87 = 34 (this is the same as previous, just in a different order)
From the above calculations, we can see that 60 + 61 - 87 equals 34. Therefore, the equation is 60 + 61 - 87 = 34.
</think>
<answer> 60 + 61 - 87 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 22, 17, and 87 exactly once to get 92. Let's try combining them using different operations.
First, let's see if we can get close to 92 by adding and subtracting these numbers.
22 + 17 + 87 = 126 (too high)
22 + 87 - 17 = 92 (this looks promising)
So, the equation that works is 22 + 87 - 17 = 92.
</think>
<answer> (22 + 87) - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 74, 60, 48, and 99 exactly once to get 37. Let's try combining them in different ways with basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's add and subtract to see if we can get closer:
74 + 60 + 48 + 99 = 271 (too high)
74 + 60 + 99 + 48 = 281 (still too high)
74 + 60 + 99 + 48 - 223 = 37 (223 is 74 + 60 + 99 + 48 - 37) This doesn't work as 223 is not in the set.
Let's try another approach, combining them in different ways:
74 + 99 - 60 - 48 = 75 (too high)
74 + 99 - 60 = 113 (too high)
74 + 99 - 60 + 48 = 161 (too high)
Now, let's try this:
99 - 74 - 60 + 48 = 3 (still too low)
99 - 74 + 60 + 48 = 113 (too high)
Lastly, let's do:
99 + 60 - 74 - 48 = 37
This works:
99 + 60 - 74 - 48 = 37
</think>
<answer> 99 + 60 - 74 - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 74, 60, 48, and 99 exactly once to get a result of 37. Let's try different combinations:
- 99 - 74 = 25 (no luck)
- 99 - 60 = 39 (not 37)
- 99 - 48 = 51 (no match)
- 99 - 74 = 25 (already tried)
- 99 - 60 - 48 = -19 (no match)
- 60 + 48 = 108 (no match)
- 74 + 60 = 134 (no match)
Now let's try combining them in different groupings:
- 74 + 60 - 48 - 99 = 74 + 60 - 147 = 134 - 147 = -13 (no match)
- 74 + 60 - 99 - 48 = 74 + 60 - 147 = 74 - 87 = -13 (no match)
- 74 - 60 + 48 - 99 = 14 + 48 - 99 = 62 - 99 = -37 (no match)
Finally, let's try another combination:
- 99 + 60 - 74 - 48 = 159 - 122 = 37
So we found a solution where 99 + 60 - 74 - 48 equals 37.
</think>
<answer> 99 + 60 - 74 - 48 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 48, 80, and 40 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 50. 
First, let's consider the operations:
- Addition: 48 + 80 = 128 (too high)
- Subtraction: 80 - 48 = 32 (still too high)
- Multiplication: 48 * 40 = 1920 (too high)
- Division: 48 / 40 = 1.2 (too low)
Now let's try combining the numbers in different ways:
- 80 - 48 = 32, and then 32 + 40 = 72 (too high)
- 80 - 40 = 40, and then 40 - 48 = -8 (not equal to 50)
- 48 - 40 = 8, and then 80 - 8 = 72 (too high)
Considering the numbers, another possible way:
We can check 80 - (48 + 40 / 40) = 80 - (48 + 1) = 80 - 49 = 31 (still too high)
Instead let's try:
48 + 80 / 40 = 48 + 2 = 50 (this works)
So, the equation is 48 + 80 / 40 = 50.
</think>
<answer> 48 + 80 / 40 </answer>

==============
<think> We have three numbers: 6, 31, and 24. We need to use these numbers and basic arithmetic operations to make an equation that equals 35.
- First, let's consider the possibility of using larger numbers first to get closer to 35. Adding 31 and 24 gives us 55.
- Subtracting 6 from 55 gives us 49, which is too high.
- Subtracting 24 from 55 gives us 31.
- Subtracting 31 from 55 gives us 24.
- Adding 6 and 24 gives us 30.
- Adding 6 and 31 gives us 37.
None of these just work directly, so let's try different combinations:
- 31 - 6 + 24 = 49 (too high)
- 31 + 24 - 6 = 55 (too high)
- 24 + 31 - 6 = 49 (too high)
We need to try multiplying and adding in different orders:
- 31 + 24 / 6 = 31 + 4 = 35 (this seems to work)
Therefore, the correct equation is 31 + 24 / 6 = 35.
</think>
<answer> 31 + 24 / 6 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an expression using the numbers 62, 98, 80, and 87 that equals 29. One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations and see if we can achieve the result.
Let's try combining 87 and 80 first:
87 + 80 = 167
This is too high. Let's try the next combination, 98 and 80:
98 + 80 = 178
This is still too high. Let's try 98 and 87:
98 + 87 = 185
This is too high as well. Now let's try 98 and 62:
98 + 62 = 160
This is still too high. Let's try 80 and 62:
80 + 62 = 142
This is too low. Now let's try a different approach, using subtraction:
Let's try 98 - (87 - 62):
98 - (87 - 62) = 98 - 25 = 73
This is too high. Let's try 62 - (87 - 98):
62 - (87 - 98) = 62 + 11 = 73
We're getting close. Let's try another combination:
Let's try 98 - (80 - 62):
98 - (80 - 62) = 98 - 18 = 80
This is too high. Let's try:
87 - (62 - 98): 
87 - (62 - 98) = 87 + 36 = 123
This is too high. Let's try one more:
98 - 87 - 62:
98 - 87 - 62 = 11 - 62 = -51
This is too low. Finally, let's try:
87 - 80 + 62 - 98:
87 - 80 + 62 - 98 = 7 + 62 - 98 = 69 - 98 = -29
This is close but negative. Let's try:
87 - 80 - 62 + 98:
87 - 80 - 62 + 98 = 7 - 62 + 98 = -55 + 98 = 43
This is still too high. The closest option is:
98 - 80 + 62 - 87 = 19 + 62 - 87 = 81 - 87 = -6
This is still wrong. Let's try a simpler combination:
98 - 87 + 62 - 80 = 11 + 62 - 80 = 73 - 80 = -7
This is still wrong. Finally, let's try:
62 - 87 + 80 - 98:
62 - 87 + 80 - 98 = -25 + 80 - 98 = 55 - 98 = -43
This is still wrong. Let's try:
98 + 62 - 87 - 80 = 160 - 87 - 80 = 73 - 80 = -7
This is still wrong. Let's try the final possible option:
98 - 87 + 80 - 62 = 11 + 80 - 62 = 91 - 62 = 29
This works! </think>
<answer> 98 - 87 + 80 - 62 </answer>

<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 4, and 58 that equals 76. 
First, let's consider the numbers and possible operations:
22 + 4 + 58 = 84 (This is more than 76)
22 + 58 - 4 = 76 (This looks promising)
Let's check if 22 + 58 - 4 equals 76:
22 + 58 = 80
80 - 4 = 76
Therefore, the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> (22 + 58) - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 32, 6, 82, and 15 exactly once to get 71. Let's try different combinations of operations.
First, let's consider if we can add or subtract the numbers to get closer to 71.
32 + 6 = 38
32 + 82 = 114 (too high)
32 + 15 = 47
32 + 6 + 82 = 120 (too high)
Now let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction:
32 * 6 = 192 (too high)
82 - 32 = 50
Both 50 and 120 didn't work out, so let's try different combinations.
32 + 82 - 15 = 100 (too high)
32 + 6 + 82 - 15 = 105 (too high)
Let's try simple subtraction and addition in a different order:
6 + 82 = 88
88 - 32 = 56
56 + 15 = 71
This is the combination we're looking for: 6 + 82 - 32 + 15 = 71.
</think>
<answer> 6 + 82 - 32 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 96, 58, and 92 that equals 54. One easy way to start is to look at the possible combinations of these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different operations:
1. 96 - 58 = 38 (not 54)
2. 96 - 92 = 4 (not 54)
3. 92 - 58 = 34 (not 54)
4. 96 + 58 = 154 (not 54)
5. 96 + 92 = 192 (not 54)
6. 58 + 92 = 150 (not 54)
7. (96 / 92) = 1.0476... (not 54)
8. 96 / 58 = 1.655... (not 54)
9. 58 / 92 = 0.634... (not 54)
10. 92 / 58 = 1.591... (not 54)
11. 96 * 58 = 5528 (not 54)
12. 92 * 58 = 5376 (not 54)
One combination stands out:
(96 - 92) + 58 = 4 + 58 = 62 (not 54)
Then we can try another set:
Also possible is:
(96 - 92) + (58 / 2) = 4 + 29 = 33 (not 54)
Correctly, it should be:
96 - 58 - 92 = -54 (not 54)
Trying another way:
- (96 - 58) + 92 = -38 + 92 = 54
Thus, the equation could be:
-(96 - 58) + 92 = 54
</think>
<answer> -(96 - 58) + 92 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 96, 58, and 92 that equals 54. Each number can only be used once.
Let's start by looking at the possible combinations we can make:
- 96 - 58 = 38
- 96 - 92 = 4
- 96 + 58 = 154
- 92 - 58 = 34
- 92 + 58 = 150
None of these combinations equals 54. Let's try different arrangements:
- 96 - (92 - 58) = 96 - 34 = 62
- 92 - (96 - 58) = 92 - 38 = 54
One of the possible equations is 92 - (96 - 58).

<think> We need to use the numbers 39, 15, and 86 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 62. Let's try different combinations:
- 86 - 39 - 15 = 32 (not 62)
- 86 - 39 + 15 = 62 (this looks promising)
- 86 + 39 - 15 = 110 (not 62)
- 86 + 39 + 15 = 140 (not 62)
From the above calculations, we can see that 86 - 39 + 15 equals 62.
</think>
<answer> 86 - 39 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 39, 15, and 86 exactly once to get 62. Let's try different combinations of operations.
One way to approach this is by checking if any of the numbers are close to 62 or if their combination can get us there. Notice that:
86 - 39 = 47 (not 62)
39 + 15 = 54 (not 62)
86 - 15 = 71 (not 62)
39 + 86 = 125 (too high)
15 + 86 - 39 = 62
This gives us the combination where 15 + 86 gives us 101, and then subtracting 39 from 101 yields 62.
</think>
<answer> (15 + 86) - 39 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 39, 15, and 86 exactly once to get 62 using basic arithmetic operations. 
Let's consider different combinations:
- 86 - 39 - 15 = 32 (not 62)
- 86 - 39 + 15 = 62 (this looks promising)
- 86 + 39 - 15 = 109 (not 62)
- 86 + 15 - 39 = 52 (not 62)
From the above combinations, 86 - 39 + 15 equals 62.

<think> We need to use the numbers 32, 87, and 4 exactly once to get 51. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
First, 32 + 87 = 119 which is too large.
Then, 87 - 32 = 55 which is close but not 51.
Let's try 87 + 4 - 32. This gives 87 + 4 = 91 and then 91 - 32 = 59, which is still too high.
Now let's try 87 - 4 - 32. This gives 87 - 4 = 83 and then 83 - 32 = 51, which is the number we need.
So, the equation is 87 - 4 - 32 = 51.
</think>
<answer> (87 - 4) - 32 </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 8, 29, 83, and 94. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once, with the operators +, -, *, and /, to get 26.
One way to approach this is to consider operations that might yield a manageable result quickly.
First, let's try combinations of the larger numbers:
- 83 - 8 - 29 = 46 (too high)
- 83 - 8 - 94 = -19 (too low)
- 94 - 8 - 29 = 57 (too high)
Let's try another combination:
- 83 - 29 = 54
- 83 - 29 - 8 = 46 (still too high)
- 83 + 29 = 112 (too high)
- 83 + 29 + 8 = 120 (too high)
Now let's try using division:
- 83 / 8 = 10.375
- 83 + 29 = 112
This combination is still too high.
Trying another combination:
- 94 - 83 = 11
- 11 + 8 + 29 = 40 (too high)
- 94 - 83 - 8 = 3
This is close, but we need to adjust.
Let's try another combination:
- 94 - 83 = 11
- 11 + 29 = 40
This is still too high.
Finally, trying this:
- (94 - 83) = 11
- 11 + 8 + 29 = 40
It seems like we're not getting 26. Let's try:
- (83 - 8) = 75
- 75 + 29 = 104
This combination is too high.
Trying:
- 94 - 83 = 11
- 11 + 29 = 40 (still too high)
Then I see:
- (83 - 94) = -11
- -11 + 29 + 8 = 26
This finally gets us to 26.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 94) + 29 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 8, 29, 83, and 94 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 26.
One approach is to check possible combinations of these numbers with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we consider the subtraction: 94 - 83 = 11. Then, trying to use the other numbers 8 and 29 in a way that gives us 15 when added or subtracted in some form might work.
11 + 8 + 29 - 83 = -35 (This is incorrect as it exceeds 26)
94 - 83 + 8 + 29 = 49 (This is also incorrect as it exceeds 26)
Trying combinations like 94 - 83 + 29 = 40 or combinations with 8:
8 + 29 + 94 - 83 = 42 (Incorrect)
8 + 29 + 83 - 94 = 26 (This works as it equals 26)
So we found a combination that works: 8 + 29 + 83 - 94 = 26
</think>
<answer> (8 + 29 + 83) - 94 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 8, 29, 83, and 94 exactly once to get 26. 
First, let's try to see if we can get close to 26 from these numbers using the operations.
Considering addition and subtraction: 
- 8 + 29 = 37 (too high)
- 37 - 83 = -46 (too low)
- 83 - 29 = 54 (too high)
- 83 - 29 - 8 = 46 (too high)
- 94 - 83 = 11 (too low)
Considering multiplication and division:
- 8 * 29 = 232 (way too high)
- 83 * 94 = 7742 (way too high)
- 94 / 83 = 1. 137 (too low)
- 83 / 94 = 0. 885 (too low)
Considering a combination:
- 94 - 83 + 29 = 41 (too high)
- 94 - 83 - 8 = 3 (too low)
- 83 + 29 - 94 = 18 (too low)
The closest we got was 37 from 8 + 29, but it's too high. If we rearrange the terms like 94 - 83 - 29 would result in 1 (which is too low). The only method that gives us near the value is 8 + 29 but we need to find another way to use numbers.
Considering mix of 8 and 94:
94 - 83 = 11
11 + 29 = 40.
And 40 - 8 = 32 which is still not 26.
One last combination:
- 94 - 83 - (29 - 8)
  = 94 - 83 - 21
  = 1 - 21
  = -20
This is also not 26.
Let's check possible rearrangement:
- 94 + 29 - 83 (94 + 29 = 123, 123 - 83 = 40, not 26)
- Checking other possible orderings will result in already calculated wrong combinations.
Let's try a different arrangement: 
- 83 - 83 + 29 + 8
  = 0 + 29 + 8
  = 37 (which is again too high)
- Recalculating rearrangement:
  83 + 29 - (94 - 8) 
  = 83 + 29 - 86
  = 83 + 29 - 86
  = 112 - 86 = -24, still not right.
Finally, we should recheck the last possible combination:
- 94 - (83 + 29) + 8
  = 94 - 112 + 8
  = 94 - 112 + 8
  = -18 + 8
  = -10 (still not right)
Running through combinations, the combination:
- 83 + 29 - (94 - 8)
  = 83 + 29 - 86
  = 112 - 86
  = -24 (Still wrong)
Lastly, I found:
- 83 + 29 - (94 - 8) = 29 + 83 - 86 = 26
</think>
<answer> 83 + 29 - 94 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 15, 93, 56, and 48 exactly once to get 100. Let's try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
One possible way could be:
93 - 56 = 37
Then,
37 + 48 = 85
We are short of 15 to reach 100. If we add 15 to 85:
85 + 15 = 100
So the equation is: (93 - 56) + 48 + 15 = 100
</think>
<answer> (93 - 56) + 48 + 15 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to combine the numbers 19, 47, and 64 using basic arithmetic operations to get 92. Each number can only be used once.
19 + 47 = 66
66 + 26 = 92 but 26 is not one of our numbers.
Let's try another combination:
64 + 47 = 111, which is too large.
64 + 19 = 83, which is close but still not 92.
47 + 19 = 66 and then 66 + 26 = 92, but 26 is not available.
Let's try another:
19 + 64 = 83, then 83 + 9 = 92 (but 9 is not one of the numbers)
Let's try:
47 + 64 = 111 - 21 = 92 (21 is not available)
Now, let's try:
19 + 47 = 66 and 66 + 26 = 92, but we can't use 26.
Finally, let's try rearranging:
64 - 19 = 45, then 45 + 47 = 92 (but 45 + 47 is 92)
Actually, 64 + 19 = 83 and then 92 - 83 = 9, but 9 is not one of the numbers.
The correct step-by-step combination is actually:
47 + (64 - 19) = 47 + 45 = 92.
</think>
<answer> 47 + (64 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 19, 47, and 64 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 92. Let's try combining the numbers in different ways:
- Adding: 19 + 47 + 64 = 130 (not 92)
- Subtracting: 64 - 19 - 47 = -18 (not 92)
- Multiplying: There seems to be no simple combination of these numbers when multiplied that gives 92.
- Checking operations in combination:
  19 + 47 - 64 = 26 (not 92)
  64 + 47 - 19 = 92 (This looks promising)
So, 64 + 47 - 19 equals 92.
</think>
<answer> 64 + 47 - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> We have three numbers: 52, 54, and 68. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to equal 38.
- Let's consider if we can get close to 38 by adding or subtracting these numbers.
- 52 + 54 = 106, which is too large.
- 52 + 68 = 120, also too large.
- 54 + 68 = 122, too large.
- 52 - 54 = -2, which is too small.
- 52 - 68 = -16, also too small.
- Now let's try combinations with multiplication and division:
- 54 * 52 / 68, but we need to check if this equals 38.
- Calculating this: 54 * 52 / 68 = 2772 / 68 = 40.8571, not 38.
- Another combination could be 54 - 52 + 68, but this equals 68, not 38.
- Let's try 54 + 68 - 52, which gives us:
- 54 + 68 - 52 = 122 - 52 = 70, not 38.
- Another possibility is 54 + (68 - 52), which results in:
- 54 + (68 - 52) = 54 + 16 = 70, still not 38.
- Considering different pairings and operations, we realise that:
- (68 - 52) + 54 gives exactly:
- 68 - 52 = 16
- 16 + 54 = 70, not 38.
- Finally, testing one final option: (54 + 52) - 68:
- 54 + 52 = 106
- 106 - 68 = 38
This combination works because (54 + 52) - 68 equals 38. </think>
<answer> (54 + 52) - 68 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 94, 52, 12, and 24 exactly once to get 54. Let's try different combinations:
One possible combination is: 
94 - 52 - 12 + 24
This gives us:
94 - 52 = 42
42 - 12 = 30
30 + 24 = 54
So, the equation that equals 54 is 94 - 52 - 12 + 24.
</think>
<answer> 94 - 52 - 12 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 68, 74, and 44 exactly once to get 98. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
First, let's consider multiplication and addition:
68 * 74 = 4952
That's too high.
Now, let's try:
68 + 74 + 44 = 186
That's also too high.
Let's try another approach:
74 + 44 - 68 = 40
That's not it.
Next, let's try:
74 - 68 + 44 = 50
Still not the result we want.
Let's try:
74 - (68 - 44) = 74 - 24 = 50
That's close but not 98.
Another try:
(74 - 44) + 68 = 30 + 68 = 98
This works!
So the equation is (74 - 44) + 68 = 98.
</think>
<answer> (74 - 44) + 68 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation using the numbers 7, 39, 25, and 83 exactly once to get 12. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, let's try multiplication and addition:
7 * 39 + 25 = 273 + 25 = 298 (not 12)
Then, let's try:
7 * 39 + 25 - 83 = 273 + 25 - 83 = 298 - 83 = 215 (not 12)
Now, let's try:
83 - 7 - 39 = 76 - 39 = 37 (not 12)
We've tried several combinations and none seem to work. Let's try a different strategy:
(83 - 7 - 25) * 1/39 = (76 - 25) * 1/39 = 51 * 1/39 = 1.315789 (not 12)
We haven't tried division yet:
7 * 39 + 25 / 83 = 273 + 0.301209 = 273.301209 (not 12)
Finally, let's try this:
(83 - 25) - 7 - 39 = 58 - 7 - 39 = 51 - 39 = 12
This gives us the desired result of 12.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 25) - 7 - 39 </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 44, 38, and 59 to use in an equation that equals 65. We need to use each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 59 - 38 + 44 = 65
   59 - 38 = 21
   21 + 44 = 65
This combination works. Therefore, the equation is 59 - 38 + 44 = 65.
</think>
<answer> 59 - 38 + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 44, 38, and 59 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 65. Let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- First, let's check if we can get close to 65 by adding and subtracting these numbers.
- Trying 59 + 38 = 97 (too high)
- Trying 59 + 44 = 103 (too high)
- Trying 44 + 38 = 82 (too low)
- Trying 59 - 38 = 21 (too low)
- Trying 59 - 44 = 15 (too low)
- Trying 44 - 38 = 6 (too low)
Now, let's try combinations of multiplication and division.
- Trying 59 * 38 / 44 is not an integer, so it doesn't work.
- Trying 59 * 44 / 38 and 38 * 59 / 44 don't work either.
- Trying 59 / 44 * 38, again it's not an integer.
- Let's try 38 * 44 / 59. Calculating this gives 38 * 44 / 59 = 30.0847... which is not an integer and doesn't work.
- Let's try 59 * 44 / 38. Calculating this gives 59 * 44 / 38 = 67.15789... which is not 65.
- Let's try 59 * 44 / 38 gives us 67.16 (not 65).
Finally, let's try 59 + 38 - 44 = 59 + 38 - 44 = 53 (still not 65).
I realize that 59 + 38 - 44 = 53 indeed doesn't work, but let's try alternative combinations with numbers rearranged in different orders.
Indeed, 44 + 59 - 38 equals 65.
</think>
<answer> 44 + 59 - 38 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 50, 9, and 12 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 53.
Let's try different combinations:
- 50 + 9 + 12 = 61 (too high)
- 50 + 9 - 12 = 47 (too low)
- 50 - 9 + 12 = 53 (this is it! )
Therefore, the equation that equals 53 is 50 - 9 + 12.
</think>
<answer> 50 - 9 + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 39, 14, and 27 exactly once to get 52. Let's start by checking combinations of addition and subtraction:
- 39 + 14 + 27 = 78 (too high)
- 39 + 14 - 27 = 26 (too low)
- 39 - 14 + 27 = 52 (this looks promising)
So the equation using these numbers exactly once is 39 - 14 + 27 = 52.
</think>
<answer> 39 - 14 + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 36, 28, and 24 exactly once to make 88 using basic arithmetic operations. 
Let's try different combinations:
1. 36 - 28 = 8, then 8 + 24 = 32 (too low)
2. 36 - 24 = 12, then 12 + 28 = 40 (too low)
3. 36 + 28 = 64, then 64 + 24 = 88 (this seems to work)
So the equation that gives us 88 is 36 + 28 + 24.
</think>
<answer> 36 + 28 + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 52, 47, 54, and 81 that equals 72. Each number can only be used once.
Let's try different combinations:
52 + 47 + 54 + 81 = 234 (too big)
54 + 81 + 47 - 52 = 122 (too big)
54 + 81 - 47 - 52 = 36 (too small)
Now let's try:
54 + 47 - 81 + 52 = 72
Let's check:
54 + 47 = 101
101 - 81 = 20
20 + 52 = 72
This works!
</think>
<answer> 54 + 47 - 81 + 52 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 66, 30, and 8, each exactly once, to make 28. Let's try different combinations of operations:
1. Simple addition and subtraction: 66 + 30 + 8 = 104 (too high)
   66 + 30 - 8 = 98 (too high)
   66 + 8 - 30 = 44 (still too high)
2. Multiplication and addition: 66 * 30 + 8 = 2008 (way too high)
3. Combination like (66 * 30) / 8: 66 * 30 = 1980, then 1980 / 8 = 247.5 (not an integer)
4. 66 - (30 + 8): 66 - 38 = 28 (this works)
So, the correct equation is 66 - (30 + 8) = 28.
</think>
<answer> 66 - (30 + 8) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 95, 81, and 11 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 25.
- Let's start by adding the smallest two numbers: 11 + 81 = 92
- Now we need to get from 92 closer to 25. Subtracting 95 from 92 gives us: 92 - 95 = -3
- We are not there yet, let's try another combination. 81 - 11 = 70
- Now if we add 95 to 70, we get 165 which is too high.
- What if we multiply 81 by 11, we get 891, which is also way off.
- Let's try dividing 95 by (81 - 11): 95 / 70 = 1. 3571, which is not 25.
- Let's try another permutation: 95 - (81 - 11) = 95 - 70 = 25
This shows that 95 - 70 equals 25.
</think>
<answer> 95 - (81 - 11) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 39, 67, and 33 exactly once to get 61. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Adding, subtracting, or multiplying 39, 67, and 33 doesn't get us close to 61.
- The only feasible operation left is division.
If we divide 67 by 33 and then add 39, we get:
67 / 33 + 39 = 2.0303 + 39 = 41.0303, which is not 61.
If we divide 67 by 39 and then add 33, we get:
67 / 39 + 33 = 1.7179 + 33 = 34.7179, which is not 61.
If we divide 39 by 33 and then add 67, we get:
39 / 33 + 67 = 1.1818 + 67 = 68.1818, which is not 61.
Finally, if we divide 33 by 39 and then add 67, we get:
33 / 39 + 67 = 0.8462 + 67 = 67.8462, which is not 61.
It seems none of these combinations work. However, another combination could be 67 - 33 + 39:
67 - 33 + 39 = 34 + 39 = 73, which is also not 61.
After reviewing all possibilities, it appears I made an oversight. If we use 67 - 39 + 33:
67 - 39 + 33 = 28 + 33 = 61, which is the desired result.
</think>
<answer> 67 - 39 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 99, 15, and 3 to use once each to get a result of 81. 
- First, let's see if there's a combination of these numbers that could easily lead to 81.
- If we consider multiplication, 99 * 3 = 297, which is too large. 
- If we consider subtraction or division involving 99 or 15, it's hard to get 81 quickly.
- Let's try 99 - 15 and see what's left over.
  99 - 15 = 84
  Now we have 84 - 3 = 81
Thus, the equation is 99 - 15 - 3 = 81.
</think>
<answer> (99 - 15) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 81, 35, 31, and 72 exactly once to get 87. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, let's try subtraction:
81 - 35 = 46
Now we need 41 more to reach 87:
46 + 31 = 77
47 is still short of 87:
46 + 72 = 118
That doesn't work. Let's try another approach:
81 - 31 = 50
We need 37 more to reach 87:
50 + 37 = 87
37 from 35 and 2:
35 + 72 - 31 = 76
That still doesn't work. Let's try the other combinations:
72 - 35 = 37
We need 50 more:
37 + 81 = 118
That doesn't work either. Finally, let's try:
81 - 35 + 31 = 77
We need 10 more to reach 87:
77 + 72 = 149
That doesn't fit either. Lastly:
81 + 35 - 31 = 85
We need two more to reach 87:
85 + 72 = 157
This is not fitting. The only successful combination seems to be:
(81 - 35) + (72 - 31) = 87
</think>
<answer> (81 - 35) + (72 - 31) </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 53, 27, and 66 to make 40 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
- 53 - 27 = 26 (not 40)
- 66 - 53 = 13 (not 40)
- 66 - 27 = 39 (not 40)
- 53 + 27 = 80 (not 40)
- 66 + 27 = 93 (not 40)
- Now let's try operations on smaller sums:
Try 53 - (27 + 66) = 53 - 93 = -40 (too negative)
53 - 27 + 66 = 32 + 66 = 98 (too large)
Try 66 - (27 - 53) = 66 - (-26) = 66 + 26 = 92 (too large)
Try 66 + (27 - 53) = 66 + (-26) = 66 - 26 = 40.
This combination works.

<think> We need to use the numbers 50, 51, and 72 exactly once to get 29. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- First, let's try 72 - 51 - 50: This equals -29, which is not 29.
- Next, let's try 72 - 51 + 50: This equals 71, which is not 29.
- Now, let's try 72 + 51 - 50: This equals 73, which is not 29.
- Let's try 72 - (51 + 50): This equals 72 - 101 = -29, which is not 29.
- Let's try 51 + 50 - 72: This equals 101 - 72 = 29.
So, we can use 51 + 50 - 72 to get 29.
</think>
<answer> 51 + 50 - 72 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 50, 51, and 72 exactly once to make 29. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One idea is to see if 72 minus 51 minus 50 could work:
72 - 51 - 50 = -29
This is close but not quite right. Let's try another combination:
52 - 72 + 50 = -54
This is incorrect. Let's try multiplying and adding:
50 * 51 / 72 = 35. 8333... which is not 29
Finally, let’s try:
72 + 51 - 50 = 73 (which is not 29)
None of these work as it turns out, and a reevaluation of other basic arithmetic combinations is needed. We might actually need to mix operations:
(72 - 50) - 51 would give us -29. But it needs positive 29. Let’s try reversing:
72 - (50 + 51) makes -29 too. But if we try other smaller combinations:
50 + (72 - 51) equals 71, not 29 either.
This process didn't find the right equation. However, one clue is that 72 - 51 equals 21 - and 21 - 50 gives -29.
Let's test minimizing guess correctly:
(72 + 51 - 50*1) as wasn't correctly handled, thus equating:
(50 + 51 - 72) shen it'll yield 29!
(50 + 51 - 72) no number manipulation didn't yield, also 72 -50 -51 gives -29 form. So correct analysis? </think>
<answer> (50 + 51 - 72) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 7, 5, and 63 exactly once to reach the number 98 using basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to consider multiplication and addition/subtraction.
Notice that 63 can be used as a base. If we multiply 7 by 9, we get 63, but we need 98, not 63. So we need an additional value.
Let's consider adding 5 to 63: 63 + 5 = 68. Now we need an additional 30 to reach 98. We already have 63 + 5 = 68, and 98 - 68 = 30. So 30 would be obtained by subtracting 63 - 93/3, but 93/3 isn't an integer.
Another perspective is to check other combinations. Let's use 7 * 63 = 441, which is too large. Then, let's consider: (7 * 63) + 5 = 441 + 5 = 446, which is also far off.
Therefore, we need to reconsider. Since we can't get exactly 63 directly with 7, let's consider another approach: can we use 5 to modify 63 in a useful way?
63 + 5 * 7 works since 5 * 7 = 35 and 63 + 35 = 98.
</think>
<answer> 63 + 5 * 7 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 20, 79, 11, and 17 exactly once to get 53. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 79 - 20 - 11 - 17 = 21 (too high)
- 79 - 20 + 11 - 17 = 53 (this looks promising)
- 79 - 20 + 11 + 17 = 87 (too high)
- 79 + 20 - 11 - 17 = 71 (too high)
So, the combination 79 - 20 + 11 - 17 works to get 53. However, we can try another combination to verify:
- 79 - 20 - 11 + 17 = 55 (too high)
- 79 - 20 + 11 + 17 = 87 (too high)
It seems combining addition with subtraction gives us 53. But let's try another direction:
- 79 + 20 - 11 - 17 = 81 (too high)
- 79 + 20 - 11 + 17 = 105 (too high)
The correct solution seems to be: 79 - 20 + 11 - 17 = 53.

<think> We need to use the numbers 21, 67, 78, and 62 exactly once to get 52 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
- 78 + 67 - 21 - 62 = 103 - 83 = 20 (too high)
- 78 + 67 - 21 + 62 = 103 + 41 = 144 (too high)
- 78 + 67 + 21 - 62 = 145 - 62 = 83 (too high)
- 78 + 67 + 21 + 62 = 228 (too high)
- 78 + 67 - (21 + 62) = 145 - 83 = 62 (too low)
- 78 + 62 - (21 + 67) = 140 - 88 = 52
This last combination works because 78 + 62 = 140 and 21 + 67 = 88, so 140 - 88 = 52

<answer> 78 + 62 - (21 + 67) </answer>

<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 41, 3, 68, and 25 that equals 55. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Starting with subtraction: 68 - 41 - 3 - 25 = 0
- Trying multiplication and addition: 41 * 3 + 68 - 25 = 123 + 68 - 25 = 161
- Trying different combinations: (68 - 41) + 3 + 25 = 27 + 3 + 25 = 55
The equation (68 - 41) + 3 + 25 correctly equals 55.
</think>
<answer> (68 - 41) + 3 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 41, 3, 68, and 25 exactly once to get 55. Let's try combining them using different operations:
One possible combination could be: 68 + 25 - 41 - 3
Let's calculate it:
68 + 25 = 93
93 - 41 = 52
52 - 3 = 49
This isn't 55, so this combination isn't correct.
Let's try another combination: 68 - 41 + 25 - 3
Let's calculate it:
68 - 41 = 27
27 + 25 = 52
52 - 3 = 49
This isn't 55 either.
Let's try a different combination: 68 + 25 - 41 + 3
Let's calculate it:
68 + 25 = 93
93 - 41 = 52
52 + 3 = 55
This equals 55, which is what we want.
Therefore, our equation is: 68 + 25 - 41 + 3 = 55
</think>
<answer> 68 + 25 - 41 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 41, 3, 68, and 25 that equals 55. Let's try different combinations:
1. 68 + 41 - 25 - 3 = 86 - 25 - 3 = 61 - 3 = 58 (too high)
2. 68 + 41 - 25 + 3 = 86 + 3 - 25 = 89 - 25 = 64 (still too high)
3. 68 + 41 + 25 - 3 = 114 + 25 - 3 = 139 - 3 = 136 (way too high)
4. 68 + 41 + 25 + 3 = 136 + 3 = 139 (very close but still too high)
5. 68 + (41 - 25 + 3) = 68 + (16 + 3) = 68 + 19 = 87 (too high)
6. 68 + (41 + 25 - 3) = 68 + (66 - 3) = 68 + 63 = 131 (way too high)
7. 41 + 68 + 25 - 3 = 114 + 25 - 3 = 139 - 3 = 136 (too high)
8. 3 + 41 + 68 + 25 = 0 + 114 + 25 = 139 (too high)
9. 41 + 3 + 68 + 25 = 44 + 68 + 25 = 112 + 25 = 137 (too high)
10. 3 + 41 + 68 + 25 = 44 + 68 + 25 = 112 + 25 = 137 (close but still too high)
11. 3 + 41 + (68 - 25) = 3 + 41 + 43 = 44 + 43 = 87 (too high)
12. 3 + 41 - 25 + 68 = 3 + 16 + 68 = 20 + 68 = 88 (too high)
13. 3 + 41 + 25 - 68 = 3 + 66 - 68 = 69 - 68 = 1 (too low)
14. 68 - 41 + 3 + 25 = 27 + 3 + 25 = 30 + 25 = 55 (bingo! )
So the equation 68 - 41 + 3 + 25 equals 55.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 41 + 3 + 25 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 86, 45, and 18 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 59. Let's try some combinations:
1. 86 - 45 - 18 = 23 (Not 59)
2. 86 - 45 + 18 = 59 (This matches our target)
3. 86 + 45 - 18 = 113 (Too high)
4. 86 + 45 + 18 = 149 (Too high)
From the above calculations, we can see that 86 - 45 + 18 equals 59.
</think>
<answer> 86 - 45 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 19, 86, and 48 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 57. 
Let's try different combinations:
19 + 86 = 105 (too high)
19 + 48 = 67 (too high)
86 + 48 = 134 (too high)
19 - 86 = -67 (too low)
86 - 19 = 67 (too high)
48 - 19 = 29 (not 57)
Now, let's try other combinations:
(86 - 48) + 19 = 38 + 19 = 57
(86 + 48) - 19 = 134 - 19 = 115 (too high)
(48 - 86) + 19 = -38 + 19 = -19 (too low)
We successfully found that (86 - 48) + 19 equals 57.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 48) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation using the numbers 66, 18, 8, and 44 that equals 12. One way to approach this is to try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, let's try some basic operations:
66 - 18 - 8 - 44 = 16 (not 12)
66 - 18 + 8 - 44 = 12
This looks promising! Let's verify:
66 - 18 + 8 - 44 = 12
This simplifies to:
48 + 8 - 44 = 12
56 - 44 = 12
12 = 12
So, the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 18 + 8 - 44 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 66, 18, 8, 44 exactly once to get the result 12. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- First, let's try multiplication and division. 66 * 8 / 18 = 3.777... (not close to 12)
- Trying 66 - 18 + 8 - 44: 66 - 18 + 8 - 44 = 12 (this seems promising)
Checking the operations manually:
66 - 18 + 8 - 44 = 12
This equation holds true.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 18 + 8 - 44 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 29, 17, and 1 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 11. 
One approach could be to consider which combination of these numbers, with addition and subtraction, might give us the result of 11.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 29 - 17 - 1 = 11 (This works)
2. 29 - 17 + 1 = 13 (Doesn't equal 11)
3. 29 + 17 - 1 = 45 (Doesn't equal 11)
4. 29 + 17 + 1 = 47 (Doesn't equal 11)
5. 17 - 29 + 1 = -11 (Doesn't equal 11)
6. 17 + 29 - 1 = 45 (Doesn't equal 11)
So the correct equation is 29 - 17 - 1 = 11.
</think>
<answer> (29 - 17) - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation using the numbers 94, 20, and 23 that equals 91. Let's try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
One possible approach is to subtract smaller numbers from larger ones.
If we subtract 23 from 94, we get 71.
Next, we subtract 20 from 71, which gives us 51.
However, this doesn't give us 91.
We need to find another combination. 
Let's try using 23 first: 
94 - 20 - 23 = 51
This is not 91.
Now, let's try a different combination:
94 - 23 - 20 = 51
This is also not 91.
Let's try another combination:
(94 - 23) + 20 = 71 + 20 = 91
This does equal 91.
So, the equation is: (94 - 23) + 20 = 91.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 23) + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 75, 76, and 71 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 70. Let's try different combinations:
- First, consider if we can use the subtraction operation: 76 - 75 = 1, but 75 - 76 is not possible as it's negative. 
- Next, let's try multiplication and subtraction: 76 * 71 - 75 = 5316 - 75 = 5241, which is not 70.
- Now, let's try subtraction and division: 76 - (75 * 71) / 70, but 75 * 71 is 5325, and 5325 / 70 is 75.71, which is not an integer.
- Let's try 76 - 75 - 71 = -70, but this doesn't fit the requirement of the equation equaling 70.
- Considering 76 - 75 + 71 seems promising: 76 - 75 is 1, and 1 + 71 is 72, which isn't 70 but close.
- Now, let's reconsider 75 - (76 - 71) = 75 - 5 = 70, which works!
Thus, we have the equation as 75 - (76 - 71) = 70.
</think>
<answer> 75 - (76 - 71) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 75, 76, and 71 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 70. Let's try different combinations:
- 76 - 75 = 1 (not 70)
- 76 + 75 = 151 (not 70)
- 76 + 71 = 147 (not 70)
- 75 + 71 = 146 (not 70)
- 75 + (76 - 71) = 75 + 5 = 80 (not 70)
- 75 - (76 - 71) = 75 - 5 = 70 (this looks promising)
So, the correct equation is 75 - (76 - 71) which equals 70.
</think>
<answer> 75 - (76 - 71) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 75, 76, and 71 exactly once to get a result of 70 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try combinations:
- 76 - 75 = 1, which when used with 71 or 75 doesn't give us 70.
- 76 - 71 = 5, which also doesn't help as it leaves us with 75 which can't be used to reach 70.
- 75 - 71 = 4, and then we need 66 more to make 70, which isn't possible with 76.
- 75 - 76 = -1, adding 71 isn't helpful.
- 76 + 71 = 147, which is too large even with adjustments.
- 71 + 75 = 146, and then 76 - 146 isn't correct.
Let's try another combination systematically
- 76 - (75 - 71) = 76 - 4 = 72, not 70.
- (76 - 71) + 75 = 5 + 75 = 80, not correct.
- 75 * 71 / 76 = 5325 / 76 ≈ 69.53, not correct.
- 76 * 75 / 71 = 5700 / 71 ≈ 80.42, not correct.
- Trying with 75 and its inverse operations:
- 76 - 75 + 71 = 1 + 71 = 72, not 70.
- 71 - 75 + 76 = -4 + 76 = 72, not 70.
Given that none combinations seemed correctly working, we need to revisit the basic possible mixed use.
- 75 + 71 - 76 = 146 - 76 = 70.
This last combination fits our criteria.</think>
<answer> (75 + 71) - 76 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 49, 78, and 32 exactly once to get 95. Let's try different combinations of the operations:
- Starting with subtraction: 78 - 49 = 29, and 29 + 32 = 61, which is not 95.
- Trying addition and subtraction: 78 + 32 = 110, and then we need -15 to get 95. But 110 - 49 = 61, not 15.
- Multiplying and adding or subtracting: There is no combination that seems to work easily here.
- Let's try 78 + 32 - 49: 78 + 32 = 110, and 110 - 49 = 61, not 95.
- Finally, let's try 78 - 32 + 49: 78 - 32 = 46, and 46 + 49 = 95.
The equation that works is 78 - 32 + 49.
</think>
<answer> 78 - 32 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 88, 83, and 98 exactly once to get 93. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 98 - 88 = 10, then 10 + 83 = 93 (This works)
- 98 - 83 = 15, then 15 + 88 = 103 (Doesn't work)
- 88 + 83 = 171, then can't use 98 (Doesn't work)
Now, 98 - 88 = 10 and 10 + 83 = 93 is the only viable solution.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 88 + 83 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 22, 58, and 73 exactly once to make 37. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 73 - 58 - 22 = 13 - 22 = -9 (Not 37)
- 73 - 58 + 22 = 15 + 22 = 37 (This works)
So, the equation is 73 - 58 + 22 = 37.
</think>
<answer> 73 - 58 + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 56, 54, and 44 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 42. Let's try different combinations:
- 56 - 54 + 44 = 1 + 44 = 45 (not 42)
- 56 + 54 - 44 = 110 - 44 = 66 (not 42)
- 56 - (54 + 44) = 56 - 98 = -42 (not 42)
- 56 + (54 - 44) = 56 + 10 = 66 (not 42)
- (56 + 54) - 44 = 110 - 44 = 66 (not 42)
- 56 - 54 + 44 / 2 = 40 + 22 = 62 (not 42)
After trying these, the only combination that works is:
44 + 54 - 56
Let's verify:
44 + 54 - 56 = 98 - 56 = 42
This satisfies the condition of using each number once and getting 42.
</think>
<answer> 44 + 54 - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 28, 20, and 3 exactly once to make 51. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 28 + 20 + 3 = 51: This works as it uses all numbers without needing any operations.
- 28 + 20 - 3 = 45: This is close but not 51.
- 3 * 20 + 28 = 88: This is too high.
- 28 * 20 / 3: This isn't an integer and isn't 51.
The combination 28 + 20 + 3 correctly sums to 51, using all the numbers exactly once.
</think>
<answer> 28 + 20 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 28, 20, and 3 exactly once to make 51. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 28 + 20 + 3 = 51 (This works since all numbers are used exactly once and it equals 51)
- Checking other combinations like 28 + 20 - 3, 28 * 20 - 3, etc., doesn't yield 51.
So, the equation that equals 51 is 28 + 20 + 3.
</think>
<answer> (28 + 20) + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We have the numbers 3, 87, and 5, and we need to form an equation that equals 85 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we try: 87 - 3 - 5 = 85
87 - 3 = 84
84 - 5 = 79
It seems we didn't get 85. Let's try another combination: 87 - 5 + 3
87 - 5 = 82
82 + 3 = 85
This gives us the correct result of 85.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 5 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 3, 87, and 5 exactly once to get 85. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 87 - 5 - 3 = 82 (too high)
- 87 - 5 + 3 = 85 (this looks promising)
- 87 + 5 - 3 = 89 (too high)
- 5 + 3 - 87 = -81 (too low)
The combination 87 - 5 + 3 equals 85. Thus, the equation is 87 - 5 + 3.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 5 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to form an equation using the numbers 3, 87, and 5 that equals 85. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations:
One possible combination is: 87 - 3 - 5
Let's calculate:
87 - 3 = 84
84 - 5 = 79
This doesn't equal 85. Let's try another combination:
87 - 5 - 3
Let's calculate:
87 - 5 = 82
82 - 3 = 79
This also doesn't equal 85. Let's try one more combination:
5 + 3 - 87
Let's calculate:
5 + 3 = 8
8 - 87 = -79
This doesn't work either. Let's try:
3 + 5 - 87
Let's calculate:
3 + 5 = 8
8 - 87 = -79
None of these seem to work. Let's try:
87 - 5 + 3
Let's calculate:
87 - 5 = 82
82 + 3 = 85
This works! Therefore, the equation is 87 - 5 + 3 = 85.

- 95 - 50 = 45 (not 31)
- 95 - 96 = -1 (not 31)
- 95 - 80 = 15 (not 31)
- 95 + 50 = 145 (not 31)
- 95 + 96 = 191 (not 31)
- 95 + 80 = 175 (not 31)
- 96 - 50 = 46 (not 31)
- 96 + 50 = 146 (not 31)
- 96 + 80 = 176 (not 31)
- 50 + 96 = 146 (not 31)
- 50 + 80 = 130 (not 31)
- 96 - 80 = 16 (not 31)
- 95 + 50 - 96 = 50 (not 31)

- 96 - 50 + 80 = 126 (not 31)
- 96 - 50 - 80 = -34 (not 31)
- 95 + 96 - 80 = 111 (not 31)
- 95 + 96 - 50 = 131 (not 31)
Now let's try another approach:
- (96 - 50) + 80 - 95 = 31
This looks promising. Let's verify:
96 - 50 = 46
46 + 80 = 126
126 - 95 = 31
The equation (96 - 50) + 80 - 95 equals 31.

- First, let's try subtraction: 80 - 74 - 2 = 4, which is not 43.
- Then, let's try addition and subtraction: 80 + 74 - 2 = 152, which is too high.
- Next, let's try multiplication and subtraction: 80 * 2 - 74 = 160 - 74 = 86, which is too high.
- Now, let's try division and subtraction: 80 - (74 / 2) = 80 - 37 = 43.

- Then, 97 - 8 + 49 = 138, which is too high.
- Next, let's try 97 - 49 - 8. This gives us 40, still not 56.
- Then, 97 + 49 - 8 gives us 140, which is too high.

- Next, let's try adding and subtracting 14: 41 + 39 - 14 = 66. Still not 94.
- Now, consider 41 - (39 - 14): This simplifies to 41 - 25 = 16. Far from 94.
- How about 41 - ((39 - 14) / 2): This is 41 - (39 - 7) / 2 = 41 - 32 / 2 = 41 - 16 = 25. Still not 94.
- Let's try another combination: (39 + 14) - 41: This equals 53 - 41 = 12. Not 94 either.
- Finally, let's try (41 + 39) - 14: This simplifies to 80 - 14 = 66. Not 94 yet.
- We'll try reversing one more: (39 + 14) + 41: This gives 53 + 41 = 94! This looks promising.

46 - 26 = 20
20 + 9 = 29
29 + 6 = 35
This does not give us 75. Let's try another combination:
46 + 26 - 9 + 6
Let's calculate this:
46 + 26 = 72
72 - 9 = 63
63 + 6 = 69
This also does not give us 75. Let's try one more combination:
46 + 26 + 9 - 6
Let's calculate this:

- Using subtraction: 79 - 57 = 22 (too low)
- Using division: 79 / 15 = 5.266 (not 61)

  79 - 57 + 24 = 22 + 24 = 46 (too low)
- Let's try 79 - (57 - 24): 79 - 33 = 46 (still too low)
- Trying 79 - 57 - 15: 79 - 57 - 15 = 22 - 15 = 7 (too low)
- Finally, let's try 79 - (57 - 24 - 15): 79 - (57 - 79) = 79 + 22 = 101 (too high)
- Another combination: 79 - 57 + 24 - 15: 79 - 57 + 24 - 15 = 22 + 24 - 15 = 46 - 15 = 31 (too low)
- Trying 79 + 24 - 57 - 15: 79 + 24 - 57 - 15 = 103 - 72 = 31 (too low)
- Combination 79 + 24 - 57 + 15: 79 + 24 - 57 + 15 = 103 - 42 = 61
Therefore, we have found a valid equation: 79 + 24 - 57 + 15 = 61

<think> We need to use the numbers 29, 97, and 87 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 19. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 97 - 87 = 10
- 87 - 97 = -10 (not useful)
- 97 - 29 = 68
- 29 + 87 = 116
- 97 + 29 = 126
None of these combinations directly give us 19. Let's try combinations including multiplication and division:
- 97 / 29 = 3.3448 (not an integer)
- 87 / 29 = 3.0 (not an integer)
- 97 * 29 = 2813 (way too large)
- 29 * 87 = 2523 (way too large)
The only sensible combination left is to see if any number can be manipulated further:
- 97 - 87 = 10
- 10 + 29 = 39 (too large)
- 39 - 29 = 10 (not 19)
None of the valid combinations of the given numbers using basic arithmetic plus combinations seem to work. 
Upon rechecking, the only viable path could be:
29 + (97 - 87) = 29 + 10 = 39 (not 19)
It seems there is no combination using the specific numbers 29, 97, and 87 that results in 19 with basic arithmetic operations. There may be an oversight or a missed step. </think>
<answer> 29 + 87 - 97 </answer>

<think> We need to use the numbers 85, 14, and 50 exactly once to get 49 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
- 85 - 14 - 50 = 21 (not 49)
- 85 - 14 + 50 = 121 (not 49)
- 85 + 14 - 50 = 50 - 1 = 49 (this seems to work)
So the equation is 85 + 14 - 50 = 49.

<answer> 85 + 14 - 50 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 91, 20, and 97 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 26. 
The number 97 is quite large and cannot be significantly reduced or used in a simple way to reach 26. 
20 is a smaller number and could be subtracted or used in a division but not as the sole path.
91 is further removed and in such a direct manner, seem uneconomical for a direct subtraction or addition to 20.
Considering subtraction, if we try 91 - 97 = -6 which is not helpful. 
Considering addition, 91 + 20 = 111, and 91 + 20 + 97 = 208, which are also not 26.
However, let's try 97 - 91 - 20 which results in -14.
97 - 91 = 6, and then 6 - 20 = -14.
Perhaps, if we rethink considering division or other operations. 
97 -91 = 6 and then 6/20 = 0.3, which is closer but not 26.
Maybe, if we rearrange thinking: 97 - 91 = 6, and then 6 + 20 because 97 - 91 = 6 and adding 20 gives us 26.
Thus, the equation becomes 97 - 91 + 20 = 26.
</think>
<answer> 97 - 91 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 91, 20, and 97 exactly once to get 26. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 91 - 20 - 97 = -1
- 91 - 20 + 97 = 166
- 91 + 20 - 97 = 14
- 91 + 20 + 97 = 208
- 97 - 91 + 20 = 26
- 97 + 91 - 20 = 170
From the above calculations, we can see that when we use 97 - 91 + 20, we get 26.

<think> We need to use the numbers 90, 2, and 91 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 89. 
Let's try different combinations:

- 90 - 2 + 91 = 179 (not 89)
- 90 + 2 - 91 = 1 (not 89)
- 90 + 91 - 2 = 179 (not 89)
- 91 - 2 - 90 = 9 (not 89)
- 91 - 90 + 2 = 3 (not 89)
- 91 + 2 - 90 = 13 (not 89)
- 91 - (90 - 2) = 3 (not 89)
- 91 - (90 + 2) = -1 (not 89)
- 2 + 90 - 91 = 1 (not 89)
- 2 + 91 - 90 = 3 (not 89)
- 2 * 90 - 91 = 89 (this works)
So, the valid equation is 2 * 90 - 91 = 89.

<think> We need to use the numbers 20, 70, and 41 exactly once to get an equation that equals 91. Let's try different combinations of operations:
1. 70 - 20 + 41 = 91
   This seems promising as it uses all numbers and the result is 91.
2. Checking the other combinations:
   20 + 70 + 41 = 131 (not 91)
   20 * 70 / 41 = 31.707 (not an integer, so not valid)
   20 * 41 - 70 = 750 - 70 = 680 (not 91)
   70 * 41 - 20 = 2870 - 20 = 2850 (not 91)
   70 + 41 - 20 = 91 (ok, but 20 is used twice)
   41 + 70 - 20 = 91 (ok, but 20 is used twice)
So the only valid equation that uses all three numbers exactly once and equals 91 is 70 - 20 + 41 = 91.

<think> We need to use the numbers 34, 49, and 3 exactly once to get 86. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
One way to approach this is to try to get close to 86 with two of the numbers and then adjust with the third.
If we add 34 and 49, we get 83, which is 3 short of 86. Adding the 3 to 83 gives us 86. So the equation would be 34 + 49 + 3 = 86.

- 46 + 44 - 38 = 90 - 38 = 52
- 38 + 44 + 46 = 82 + 46 = 128 (too high)
- 46 + 44 + 38 = 90 + 46 = 136 (too high)
- 46 - 38 + 44 = 8 + 44 = 52 (this works)
So, the equation that equals 52 is 46 - 38 + 44.

- Trying multiplication/division: 63 * 57 / 36 = 109. 25 (not an integer and not 84)
- Trying a combination of addition, subtraction, and multiplication:

<answer> 63 - 36 + 57 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 36, 63, and 57 exactly once to make 84. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- First, let's consider subtraction: 63 - 36 = 27. Now we need 57 - 27 = 30 to reach 84, so 57 - 27 = 30.
- Checking: 63 - 36 + 57 = 27 + 57 = 84.
This works! We used all numbers and applied subtraction correctly.
</think>
<answer> 63 - 36 + 57 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 36, 63, and 57 exactly once to get 84. 
- Let's start by checking if any of the given numbers can be directly used to reach 84.
- The number 63 is close to 84, so let's see if we can reach 84 by adding or subtracting other numbers.
- If we subtract 57 from 63, we get 63 - 57 = 6. 
- Now, we need 78 more to reach 84, and the only number left is 36. Adding 36 to 6 gives us 36 + 6 = 42, but we need 78, which isn't possible with just these numbers.
- However, let's try another combination: 63 - 57 = 6, then we need 78, let's try other operations.
- If we use 63 + 57 = 120 and then subtract 36, we get 120 - 36 = 84.
This combination works. So the equation is 63 + 57 - 36 = 84.

<think> We need to use the numbers 48, 23, and 81 exactly once to get an equation that equals 10. Let's try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
- Adding, subtracting, and multiplying these numbers do not seem to get us close to 10.
- Let's try dividing:
  81 / 48 = 1.6875 (not 10)
  48 / 23 = 2.08695652 (not 10)
  48 / 81 = 0.592592592 (not 10)
  23 / 81 = 0.283253526 (not 10)
  81 / 23 = 3.52173913 (not 10)
  48 / (23 / 81) = 48 * (81 / 23) = 177.6087018
None of these straightforward divisions and multiplications are working. Let's try another combination:
  81 - 48 = 33
  33 - 23 = 10
This seems to work! So our equation is 81 - 48 - 23 = 10.

6. (71 + 37) - 50 + 13 = 108 - 50 + 13 = 58 + 13 = 71 (doesn't work)
7. 71 - (37 - 50 + 13) = 71 + (-37 + 50 - 13) = 71 + 0 = 71 (doesn't work)
8. (71 + 13) - (50 + 37) = 84 - 87 = -3 (doesn't work)

16. (71 + 13) + (50 - 37) = 84 + 13 = 97 (It works!)

Now, let's try another approach:

76 + 51 - 12 + 74 = 189 (too high)
76 + 51 + 12 - 74 = 115 (too high)
Finally, 76 + 51 + 12 - 74 = 115 (too high) seems incorrect. But if we change our order slightly:

This combination works.

Then, let's try different groupings:
76 - 51 - 12 + 74 = 77 (too big)
(76 - 51) + (12 + 74) = 21 + 86 = 107 (too big)
Now, let's try a different combination:
(76 + 12) - 51 + 74 = 88 - 51 + 74 = 37 + 74 = 111 (too big)
Let's try multiplication and addition:
(51 * 76) / 12 + 74 = 3936 / 12 + 74 = 328 + 74 = 385 (too big)
Finally, let's try:

Upon reviewing all the attempts, none seem right.
Let's check a lower combination:

Let's check this approach again:
76 - 51 + 12 + 74 = 107 (too big)
Finally checking other grouping:
(76 + 51 - 74) + 12 = (127 - 74) + 12 = 53 + 12 = 65
That fits exactly.

- 43 + 45 = 88, which isn't 13
Trying combinations of subtraction and addition:
11 - (45 - 43) = 11 - 2 = 9, which isn't 13
11 - (45 + 43) is not possible as we can't have negative results from this operation.

- 73 - 67 = 6, then 6 + 65 = 71, not 80.
- 73 - 65 = 8, then 8 + 67 = 75, not 80.
- 73 - 67 = 6, then 6 + 5 + 65 = 76, not 80.
- 73 + 65 = 138, which is too big.
- 67 + 5 + 65 = 137, which is also too big.
- 67 + 65 - 73 = 65 - 73 = -8, which is incorrect.
- Now let's give it a different approach:
- 73 + 65 = 138, which is too big.
- We can try different combinations:
- 73 + 67 + 5 = 145, which is too big.
- 67 + (73 - 65) = 67 + 8 = 75, not 80.
- 67 + 5 - 65 = 12 - 65 = -53, which is incorrect.
- 67 + 5 + 65 = 137, which is too big.
- 67 + 65 - 73 = 67 + 65 - 73 = 67 - 73 + 65 = -6 + 65 = 59, which is incorrect.
- Let's go back and try:
- 73 + 65 - 67 = 138 - 67 = 71, too big.
- Now let's try another:
- 73 + 67 + 5 - 65 = 73 + 67 + 5 - 65 = 145 - 65 = 80.
So the correct combination is 73 + 67 + 5 - 65.

<think> We need to use the numbers 30, 82, and 39 exactly once to make 91 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:
- 82 - 39 - 30 = 13 (too low)
- 82 - 39 + 30 = 73 (too high)
- 82 + 39 - 30 = 91 (this could work)
So, the equation 82 + 39 - 30 equals 91. </think>
<answer> (82 + 39) - 30 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 21, 34, 64, and 11 exactly once to get 62. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
One possible combination could be: 64 + 11 - 34 - 21
64 + 11 = 75
75 - 34 = 41
41 - 21 = 20
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
34 + 21 + 11 - 64
34 + 21 = 55
55 + 11 = 66
66 - 64 = 2
This also doesn't work. Let's try: 64 - 34 + 11 + 21
64 - 34 = 30
30 + 11 = 41
41 + 21 = 62
This works. So the equation is 64 - 34 + 11 + 21 = 62.
</think>
<answer> 64 - 34 + 11 + 21 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 55, 5, and 93 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 43. Let's try different combinations:
- 55 - 5 - 93 = -43 (too low)
- 55 - 5 + 93 = 143 (too high)
- 55 + 5 - 93 = -33 (too low)
- 55 + 93 - 5 = 143 (too high)
- 93 - 55 - 5 = 33 (too low)
- 93 - 55 + 5 = 43 (this looks promising)
So, the equation that works is 93 - 55 + 5 = 43.

<answer> 93 - 55 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 29, 5, and 63 exactly once to get 97. Let's try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- 29 + 5 + 63 = 97 (This is a possible solution since 29 + 5 + 63 equals 97)
Now let's check if there's any other combination that works:
- 29 + 63 - 5 = 87 (Not 97)
- 5 + 29 + 63 = 97 (This is the same as the first combination)
- 5 + 63 - 29 = 39 (Not 97)
- 63 - 29 + 5 = 39 (Not 97)
From the above calculations, the only combination that results in 97 is 29 + 5 + 63.
</think>
<answer> 29 + 5 + 63 </answer>

<think> We need to use the numbers 10, 55, and 39 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 84. Let's try different combinations:
- 55 + 10 + 39 = 104 (not 84)
- 39 + 55 + 10 = 104 (not 84)
- 55 + 39 - 10 = 84 (this equals 84)
So, the equation that uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 84 is 55 + 39 - 10.

- 42 - 24 + 30 = 54 (not 12)
- 42 + 24 - 30 = 36 (not 12)
- 42 + 24 + 30 = 96 (not 12)
- 30 + 24 - 42 = 12 (12 is our target)
So, 30 + 24 - 42 equals 12.

- 42 - 24 + 30 = 52
- 42 + 24 - 30 = 36
- 42 + 24 + 30 = 96
- 42 - (24 - 30) = 42 - (-6) = 48

The combination 30 - (42 - 24) equals 12.

- 52 - 22 + 66 = 96 (not 36)
- 52 + 22 - 66 = 8 (not 36)
- 52 + 22 + 66 = 139 (not 36)
- 66 - 52 + 22 = 36 (this could work)
So, the correct equation using all numbers exactly once is 66 - 52 + 22 = 36.
</think>
<answer> 66 - 52 + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 4, 13, 56, and 45 exactly once to get 92. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible combination is: 56 - 45 + 13 - 4
Calculating this:
56 - 45 = 11
11 + 13 = 24
24 - 4 = 20
This doesn't give us 92. Let's try another combination: 
45 + 13 + 56 - 4
Calculating this:
45 + 13 = 58
58 + 56 = 114
114 - 4 = 110
This also doesn't work. Let's try 45 + 56 + 13 - 4:
45 + 56 = 101
101 + 13 = 114
114 - 4 = 110
This is still not 92. Let's try 56 + 45 - 13 - 4:
56 + 45 = 101
101 - 13 = 88
88 - 4 = 84
This is not 92 either. Let's try 56 + 13 + 45 - 4:
56 + 13 = 69
69 + 45 = 114
114 - 4 = 110
This doesn't work either. Let's try 56 + 45 + 13 - 4:
56 + 45 = 101
101 + 13 = 114
114 - 4 = 110
This is still not 92. Let's try 56 + 45 + 13 - 4 in different order:
56 + 45 + 13 = 114
114 - 4 = 110
This doesn't work either. Let's try 56 + 13 + 45 - 4:
56 + 13 = 69
69 + 45 = 114
114 - 4 = 110
This is not 92. Let's try 56 + 45 + 13 - 4:
56 + 45 = 101
101 + 13 = 114
114 - 4 = 110
This is not 92. Finally, let's try (56 + 45) - (13 + 4):
56 + 45 = 101
13 + 4 = 17
101 - 17 = 84
This is not 92. Let's try 56 + 45 - (13 + 4):
56 + 45 = 101
13 + 4 = 17
101 - 17 = 84
This is not 92. Let's try (56 + 4) + (13 + 45):
56 + 4 = 60
13 + 45 = 58
60 + 58 = 118
This overestimates. The only combination that seems to fit is 56 + 45 - (13 + 4):
56 + 45 = 101
13 + 4 = 17
101 - 17 = 84
This doesn't add up. The only solution would be:
(56 + 45) - (13 + 4)
(56 + 45) - (13 + 4) = (101) - (17) = 84
No suitable equation. Final possibilities are: 
(56 + 45 - 13) + 4 or 
(56 + 45) - (13 - 4) 
(56 + 45 - 9) = 92 
Final calculation:
56 + 45 - (13 - 4) = 56 + 45 - 9 = 92

- 66 + 38 - 27 = 77 (too high)

  - 92 + 25 - 11 = 106 (Doesn't work)

- 40 + 9 - 30 = 19 (too low)

So, we have two potential answers: 40 + 30 - 9 and 30 + 40 - 9. Both are correct.
</think>
<answer> 40 + 30 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 30, 40, and 9 exactly once to get 61. 
- Let's try different combinations using the operations:
  - 40 - 30 + 9 = 19 (too low)
  - 40 + 30 - 9 = 61 (this looks promising)
  - 30 + 40 - 9 = 61 (also promising)
  - 9 + 30 + 40 = 89 (too high)
From the above combinations, both 40 + 30 - 9 and 30 + 40 - 9 give us 61. However, since we typically look for the most straightforward solution, 40 + 30 - 9 is the direct way to achieve 61 using these numbers.

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 3, 63, 47, and 96 exactly once to get the result 17 using basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One possible combination could be: 63 - 47 - 96 + 3
63 - 47 = 16
16 - 96 = -80
-80 + 3 = -77
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
3 + 63 - 47 - 96
3 + 63 = 66
66 - 47 = 19
19 - 96 = -77
This also doesn't work. Let's try:
63 + 47 - 96 - 3
63 + 47 = 110
110 - 96 = 14
14 - 3 = 11
This is still not 17. Now, let's try:
96 - 63 - 47 + 3
96 - 63 = 33
33 - 47 = -14
-14 + 3 = -11
Nothing seems to be working. Let's try a different approach:
47 - 3 + 63 - 96
47 - 3 = 44
44 + 63 = 107
107 - 96 = 11
This still doesn't work. Let us try again:
3 + 63 + 47 - 96
3 + 63 = 66
66 + 47 = 113
113 - 96 = 17
This works!
Therefore, the equation that equals 17 is 3 + 63 + 47 - 96.

3. 75 + 34 - 68 = 41
4. 75 + 34 + 68 = 177
5. 68 - 75 + 34 = 27
The combination 68 - 75 + 34 equals 27.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 75 + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 34, 75, and 68 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 27. Let's try different combinations:
- 75 - 34 - 68 = -67 (not 27)
- 75 - 34 + 68 = 109 (not 27)
- 75 + 34 - 68 = 41 (not 27)
- 75 + 34 + 68 = 177 (not 27)
- 68 - 34 + 75 = 109 (not 27)
- 34 + 75 + 68 = 177 (not 27)
It seems we can't create 27 using these numbers and basic operations. However, let's try another combination:
68 - 75 + 34 = 34 - 75 + 34 doesn't work, but
68 + 75 - 34 does work!
68 + 75 - 34 = 143 - 34 = 109 (not 27)
No success so far. Looking at the original attempts:
- 75 - 34 - 68 = -67 (not 27)
One more:
75 - 68 + 34 = 17 + 34 = 51 (not 27).
Trying 68 + 75 / 34 is closer:
68 + 75 / 34 ≈ 81. 41 (not 27)
68 - 75 + 34 = 34 - 75 + 34 ≈ -17. 41 (not 27)
Nothing works!
- 75 - 34 + 68 = 41 (not 27)
We seemed to try all possible combinations, but none works exactly at first glance.
Final check revealed it was messed, so let 68 + 75 - 34 is difficult again, and concluded
68 - (75 - 34) = 68 - 41 = 27
</think>
<answer> 68 - (75 - 34) </answer>

- 79 - 47 + 39 = 71 (not 87)

<answer> 79 + 47 - 39 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 47, 39, and 79 exactly once to get 87. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 47 + 39 - 79 = 86 (not 87)
- Another combination: 79 + 39 - 47 = 71 (not 87)
- Let's try multiplication and addition: (79 * 47) / 39 = 11833 / 39 = 299.99 (not 87)
- Let's try: 79 + (47 - 39) = 79 + 8 = 87 (this works)
So the correct combination is 79 + (47 - 39) = 87.

<answer> 79 + (47 - 39) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to construct an equation using the numbers 47, 39, and 79 exactly once to get the result 87. Let's try different combinations of +, -, *, and /.
- We can try combining 47 and 39 first: 47 + 39 = 86, which is close but not 87.
- Next, let's try 79 - 47: 79 - 47 = 32, which is not 87.
- Now let's try 79 - 39: 79 - 39 = 40, which is not 87.
- Let's try 79 + 39 - 47: 79 + 39 = 118, then 118 - 47 = 71, which is not 87.
- Next, let's try 79 + (39 - 47): 39 - 47 = -8, then 79 + (-8) = 71, which is not 87.
- Finally, let's try 79 + 39 - 47 and divide it by 2: (79 + 39 - 47) / 2 = 118 / 2 = 89, which is not 87.
- The closest we got was 79 + 39 - 47 = 71, so let's consider (79 + 39) - 47 and re-evaluate: 118 - 47 = 71, which is not 87.
- Let's try 79 + (47 - 39): 47 - 39 = 8, then 79 + 8 = 87, which is exactly the result we need.
So, the equation is 79 + (47 - 39) = 87.

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 78, 79, and 63 exactly once to get 64. Let's try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- Starting with 79 - 78 = 1 (too low)
- Next, let's try 79 - 63 = 16 (too low)
- Then, 79 + 63 = 142 (too high)
- Now, let's try 79 - 63 + 78 = 78 + 63 - 79 = 141 - 79 = 62 (still too high)
- What if we use 78 - 63 + 79? 78 - 63 = 15, then 15 + 79 = 94 (too high)
- Let's try 78 + 63 - 79 = 141 - 79 = 62 (still too high)
- Finally, let's try 79 + (78 - 63) = 79 + 15 = 94 (too high)
- We need to check smaller combinations again. Trying 78 - (63 - 79) = 78 - (-16) = 78 + 16 = 94 (too high)
- Trying 78 + (63 - 79) = 78 + (-16) = 78 - 16 = 62 (still too high)
- Using 79 + 63 + 78 will give us 160 (too high)
This is getting complicated, let's make a fresh start and test these simpler combinations: We miss a simple combination. Trying 79 - (78 - 63) = 79 - 15 = 64 which works.

62 + 22 - 18 - 8 = 68 (too high)
62 + 22 + 18 - 8 = 94 (too high)
The only combination that works is:
62 + 22 + 8 - 18 = 74 (too high)

<think> We need to use the numbers 28, 42, and 7 exactly once with the operations +, -, *, and / to get 21.
- Let's try combining 42 and 7 first: 42 + 7 = 49
- This is too high, so let's try subtraction: 42 - 7 = 35
- Still too high, so let's try 42 - 28 = 14
- Now we need 7 more to reach 21, so 14 - 7 = 7
- We need to get to 21 from here, so 21 - 7 = 14, and we already have 14 = 42 - 28
- However, another way could be: 42 - (28 / 7) = 42 - 4 = 38, which doesn't work.
- Trying another approach: 28 + 7 - 42 = 15 - 42 = -27, also does not work.
- The right sequence is: 42 - (28 / 7) = 42 - 4 = 38, and 38 - 28 = 10, doesn't work, we need to recheck:
- Perhaps we overlooked another initial operational combination, like 42 - 28 + 7 = 21

<think> We need to use the numbers 78, 7, 75, and 49 exactly once to make 53. Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
One possible combination is: 78 - 75 + 7 - 49
78 - 75 = 3
3 + 7 = 10
10 - 49 = -37
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination: 78 - 75 - 7 + 49
78 - 75 = 3
3 - 7 = -4
-4 + 49 = 45
This doesn't work either. Let's try: 78 - 75 + 49 - 7
78 - 75 = 3
3 + 49 = 52
52 - 7 = 45
This also doesn't work. Let's try: 7 + 75 + 49 - 78
7 + 75 = 82
82 + 49 = 131
131 - 78 = 53
This works. So the correct equation is 7 + 75 + 49 - 78 = 53.

This simplifies to:
154 - 119 = 35 (which is not 93)
Let's try another:
90 + 64 - 90 + 29
This simplifies to:
154 - 90 + 29 = 64 + 29 = 93
So the equation that works is: 90 + 64 - 90 + 29 = 93.
</think>
<answer> 90 + 64 - 90 + 29 </answer>

<think> We need to use the numbers 72, 36, and 26 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 28. Let's try different combinations:
- 72 - 36 - 26 = 10
- 72 - 36 + 26 = 62
- 72 + 36 - 26 = 82
- 72 + 36 + 26 = 134
- 36 - 72 + 26 = 8
- 26 - 72 + 36 = 2
None of these give us 28. Let's try another operation:
- 72 / 36 + 26 = 2 + 26 = 28
This combination works. So, the equation is 72 / 36 + 26 = 28.

- 80 - 23 - 11 + 10 = 56 (too low)
- 80 - 23 + 11 - 10 = 68 (too high)

- 80 + 23 + 11 - 10 = 104 (too high)
- 80 + 11 + 10 - 23 = 78 (too low)
- 23 + 80 + 10 - 11 = 102 (too high)
- 23 + 80 - 11 + 10 = 102 (too high)
- 23 + 11 + 10 + 80 = 124 (too high)
- 11 + 23 + 80 - 10 = 104 (too high)
- 11 + 23 - 80 + 10 = -16 (too low)
After trying several combinations, we realize that the only way to get 58 is:
11 + 23 + 80 - 10 = 104 (too high, repeated)
As none of these give us 58, let's review closer logical solutions: 80 - (23 - 10) + 11 = 78 (too high)
(80 + 11) + (23 - 10) = 94 (too high)
Difficult to find, yet re-checking every feasible way finally, verifying 10 equations consistently will not rule out though.

- 20 + 4 - 94 = -70 (Not 99)
- 4 + 94 - 20 = 78 (Not 99)
- 4 + 20 - 94 = -70 (Not 99)

10 + 29 = 39 (not 15)
50 + 40 = 90
90 - 76 = 14 (not 15)
50 + 76 = 126
126 - 40 - 29 = 57 (not 15)
We need to rearrange:
(76 - 50) + 40 + 29 - 50 = 26 + 40 + 29 - 50 = 46 + 29 - 50 = 75 - 50 = 25 (still not 15)
76 - 50 + 40 - 29 = 26 + 40 - 29 = 66 - 29 = 37 (still not 15)
76 - 50 + 40 + 29 = 26 + 40 + 29 = 66 + 29 = 95 (still not 15)
Ok, let's just use different arithmetic approach:
76 - 50 - 40 - 29 = 26 - 40 - 29 = -14 - 29 = -43 (not 15)
(76 - 50 + 40 - 29) = 26 + 40 - 29 = 66 - 29 = 37 (not 15)
Then, nothing works so far :/.

- 76 + 20 + 3 - 75 = 24 (not 18)
- 76 + 20 - 3 - 75 = 8 (not 18)
After these combinations, we see that none of the above combinations worked. We need to revisit the original values and operations:
76 - 20 + 3 - 75 = -26 (still not 18)
Next, trying with the second element:
76 - 75 - 20 + 3 = -16 (no)
Next trying by another arrangement:
76 - 75 + 20 - 3 = 8 (not 18)
Trying reordering last combination:

This is still not 54, so I need to recheck:
- 93 - 83 = 10

None are leading to 54 directly. Let's test rearrangement:
- 93 + 34 =127
- 127 - 83 = 44

No. Let me verify strictly:
We've 34, 93, 10

None of these work. Let's try another combination:
(83 - 20) + 20 = 63 + 20 = 83
Still not 84. Let's try:
83 + (20 - 20) = 83
This is not correct either. Now let's try:
(83 + 20) - 20 = 103 - 20 = 83
This is also incorrect. We need to try:
(83 - (20 - 20)) = 83 - 0 = 83.
None of them gives 84. Now let's check:
(83 + 20) + 20 = 103 + 20 = 123 → this too is incorrect.

6. 20 * 20 + 83 = 400 + 83 = 483
None of these work. Let's try another combination:
20 + 20 = 40, and then 83 - 40 = 43, and add 1 to approach 84, but we can't use a number more than once.
83 - (20 / 20) = 83 - 1 = 82

- 84 / 71 + 36 = 1. 90 + 36 = 37. 90

<answer> 36 + 71 - 84 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 84, 36, and 71 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 23. One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's try: 84 - 36 - 71. This gives us 84 - 36 = 48, and then 48 - 71 = -23. That's not it. Let's try another combination: 84 - 36 + 71. This gives us 48 + 71 = 119. That's too large. Now let's try: 84 + 36 - 71. This gives us 120 - 71 = 49. This is also not correct. Let's try 84 - (36 + 71). This gives us 84 - 107 = -23. This is close but negative. We need 23, not -23. Let's reconsider another possibility: (84 - 71) + 36. This simplifies to 13 + 36 = 49, which is too large. Then, let's try (36 + 71) - 84: This simplifies to 107 - 84 = 23, which gives the desired result. </think>

<think> We need to use the numbers 79, 87, 96, and 15 exactly once to get 89. Let's try different combinations:
- 96 - 87 + 79 + 15 = 118 (not 89)
- 96 + 87 - 79 - 15 = 98 (not 89)
- 96 + 87 + 79 - 15 = 247 (not 89)

Finally, let's try:
87 + 96 - 15 - 79 = 99 - 79 = 20 (still not 89)
Then, I have:
87 + 79 - 96 - 15 = 166 - 111 = 55 (not 89)
So the current combination isn't right:
87 + 96 - 79 - 15 = 119 - 94 = 25 (not 89)
But the correct clear step is to rearrange again:
79 + 96 + 87 - 15 = 175 - 15 = 160 or the last contradiction shows it doesn't work
Finally confirmed working right accordingly:
87 + 96 - 79 + 15 = 124 - 64 = 60 doesn't work,  working step confirms other remaining solution are 171.

- 83 - 61 + 24 + 3 = 46 - 18 ≠ 43
- 61 + 24 - 83 - 3 = -12 ≠ 43
- 61 + 24 - 83 + 3 = -12 + 36 = 24 ≠ 43
- 61 + 83 - 24 - 3 = 144 - 27 = 117 ≠ 43

74 - (70 - 15) + 64 = 74 - 55 + 64 = 83 (not 95)
74 + (70 - 15) + 64 = 74 + 55 + 64 = 193 (too high)
70 - (74 - 64) + 15 = 70 - 10 + 15 = 75 (not 95)
(74 + 70) - 64 + 15 = 144 - 64 + 15 = 95

18 + 6 + 27 = 41 (too low)
18 + 27 - 6 = 39 (still too low)
18 + 27 * 6 = 18 + 162 = 180 (too high)
27 + 18 + 6 = 45 (too low)
27 + 18 - 6 = 39 (too low)
6 + 27 - 18 = 15 (too low)
27 - 18 + 6 = 15 (too low)
Then I realize that:
18 + (27 - 6) = 18 + 21 = 39 (too low)
Finally, retry reorganizing operations:
(27 - 18) + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 (too low)
Not getting the right answer then I rather re-step my trials from initial mention:
18 + 27 + 6 = 51
This combination adds up to 51 - it should have been correctly verified:

- 35 + 84 + 79 - 86 = 112 - 86 = 26 (not 56)
I'm missing something, let's try reordering:
86 + 35 + 79 - 84 = 195 - 84 = 111 (not 56)
Ok, maybe we get close with 86 + 79 - 84 - 35 = 165 - 84 - 35 = 46 - 35 = 11 (not 56)
What if we reorder:
86 + 35 - 79 - 84 = 121 - 79 - 84 = 42 - 84 = -42 (why this approach is not relevant)
I will check in a different way:
84 + (86 - 35) - 79 = 84 + 51 - 79 = 135 - 79 = 56  ((+)-(Equals game)) Clarity: so:
84 + 86 - 35 - 79 = 170 - 114 = 56

- 57 + 90 / 39 = 57 + 2 = 59
- 39 + 57 / 90 = 39 + 0.666... (not an integer)
Trying different combinations of operations and numbers doesn't solve our problem. Let's check the basic operations straightforwardly:
- 90 - 57 - 39 = -26 (wrong)
- 90 - 57 + 39 = 62 (wrong)
- 90 + 57 - 39 = 108 (wrong)

After trying various combinations, let me try more:
(95 - 55) + (27 - 13) = 40 - 13 + 27 - 95 = 54.
So we might have mixed signs or a separate addition.

- 76 + 60 - 91 - 56 = 136 - 147 = -11
- 91 + 56 - 76 - 60 = 147 - 136 = 11
None of these worked until trying combinations again differently:
(76 - 56) + (91 - 60) = 20 - 31 = -11
Again, final calculation:
(91 + 56 - 76 - 60) = 91 - 30 = 91,
Only viable is (91 - 56) =15,
Attributes used: 91 - 56 = 35, remaining 35 - ==19 suspect previous validation error.
